I went to college at the end of the tour that I did and the Navy gave me free benefits so I've been going to my bachelor's course at the University of California at Berkeley and then my master's course at the University of Southern California.

I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies.

When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life.

My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature that I want, the people and the diversity I want. So, maybe from now on I'll always stay in California.",What is your family like?,What is your relationship with your family?,How well do you get along with your folks?,Who were your parents?,Do you like your parents?,,,,,Background,,Can you tell me more about Michigan?,"In Michigan, it's the place that I stayed had a diverse amount of people but it was mostly crime ridden in some places. I've seen lots of things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them. So, even though Michigan was, the part that I grew up in, Flint, isn't the, you know, ideal city, it is a good place to grow up and develop your character.",How was your time spent in Michigan?,What impact did Michigan have on your childhood?,Did you become who you are because of where you grew up?,How is Detroit?,How is Michigan?,What is Michigan like?,,,,"Background, Education",,What kind of student were you?,"So, the type of student that I was in college, in high school and in elementary school, it varied. It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said that I was like very very high achieving or something like that. I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down. I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started  going down to you know, very very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story. They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended up going to community college and then going to the military or some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of reasons to get motivated to study a lot. So, after I finished my active duty Navy career, I went back to college and I was on par.

So, I grew up in Los Angeles that's where I graduated from high school at and then after I did my 8 year tour in the Navy, I went to college in the San Francisco area. My college was Berkeley which is right across the bay. During my Navy stint, they sent me to San Diego. So I've had maybe two or three years in all of those cities.

What did you do?,"During wartime, the tempo is a lot higher than it normally is. So, I fought in the Iraq war and then in the Afghanistan war and during those times we were in the middle of the ocean and days were pretty long from 6 AM to sometimes midnight very very often. We did so much training. It was a very trying time but is also rewarding because your patience is tested, your drive and your motivation is tested and eventually you fight the war and you do a lot of good things.

If you want to join the Navy but you're scared of going into battle, then there are obviously jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that being in the military is by definition a dangerous career. So, I was on a ship for the most of the time but they could have sent me anywhere. So, you have to be willing to accept that fact. However, even on the ship, there are dangers. For instance, you could be telling the ships where to go but they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous places that you can be, it's one of the most dangerous jobs. Additionally, once you're back home, you're with your family, you have a normal job but they could say, ""Hey, you know what? We need more people out there in the field."" So, they could just call you and you could be with the army people, with the marines people, fighting wars. But for the most part, the air force and the navy, they tend to have supporting roles to the army and the marines.",Is the military scary?,Do I have to fight in battles if I join the military?,Do I have to risk my life to serve my country?,Will I have to go into battle if I join?,Have you been in battle?,,,,,"JobSpecific, STEM",Navy,"Though you were an Electrician's Mate, did you work on other things besides electronics?","So, my job as an EMC, Electrician's Mate is to fix pumps, to do preventive maintenance, to work on voltage regulators, to have lots of training as well. But the Navy also provides you with releases from your job. If you do the same job the whole entire time, you might get kind of frustrated, so I actually worked in the supply department which is where, for instance, there is the veins in the ship and there's like painting that needs to be done, there's lots of cleaning that has to be done. Some people work in the tech pubs library, which means that there's books for everybody on the ship that has to do their job. So you can work there for a while. So, basically for about six months to a year, you work in your main job and then they kind of give you a break even though you're on the same ship and then you have that cycle. So, you're always doing something different.",Is your position the only thing you do?,What other things do you do besides what you do with technology?,"What are duties that everyone in the Navy has to do, regardless of position?",Are electronics the only thing you worked on?,Was everything you did in the Navy about technology?,Did you do different things in the Navy?,,,,Training,Navy,What is the training progression and what is it like?,"So, with the Navy, they always give you training. That's something that's going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of your Navy tour. So, the ways that they train you is that they have one of the people in your unit go up and provide something from a book that you probably learn in A school, that you probably learn on the job. So, for instance, the diagram of the reactor and we're supposed to know, for instance, all the valves that are there, we're supposed to know what to do in case of a casualty. For instance, if there's a fire in one of the pumps, we have to say, ""Well, you're supposed to turn off valve A, B and C"", and then call it in and then we'll tell the watch officer and then ask somebody to help and then go back and fight the fire. What happens if there is like, a radiation spill? Are you supposed to, you know, do these things? So, for instance, every time that you have a casualty, which means that there is a problem in the ship, be it a fire, a flood, a scram of the reactor, which means it breaks down, then you have to know what each of those steps are. And after being in the Navy for what, a year let's say, if you don't train about it, then you're going to forget it. So, they allow a little bit of forget and then they train on it so you remember it. Then, you have that cycle of training over and over and over.",What is the training process?,What is the required training?,How is training?,Is training long?,Is training difficult?,Do they teach you a lot in the Navy?,Do you need to practice a lot in the Navy?,,,Jargon,Navy,What does EMC stand for?,"EMC stands for Electrician's Mate Chief. Really, that's Chief Electrician's Mate but they put the C on the end.",What is an EMC?,What does the abbreviation EMC mean?,What does EMC mean?,What's EMC?,,,,,,Background,Navy,Are you an officer?,"I'm not an Officer. I'm a Chief, which is an E7 for the pay grade. The military is broken up into two portions, enlisted people who actually do the work and officers who basically manage. Now, the enlisted people, after a certain pay grade, E6 or E7, you start to supervise those enlisted people. Officers, from day one, they're automatically in charge of the whole unit.",Do you have a high rank?,Are you a Captain?,Are you in charge on the ship?,Do you have a leadership role?,,,,,,"Education, JobSpecific",Navy,"You have a college degree, so why aren't you an officer?","I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but not everybody who has that degree wants to go that route. So, to be an officer, you have to want to manage people, do lots of paperwork sometimes, to be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire unit and that carries a lot of responsibility. I'm an enlisted person and I do supervise the people that are underneath me. However, an officer's main goal is to become more and more important down the line. So, for instance, if you're a captain or even a commander, you could have 300-400 people underneath you and that's the main goal of most officers. For an enlisted person, you're more technically based. So, even though you have a small unit, that drive to want to lead people is slightly different.",Why aren't you an officer?,Shouldn't you be an officer?,Do you want to be an officer?,Do you get to be an officer if you're in the military a long time?,,,,,,Jargon,Navy,What is the difference between an officer and an enlisted person?,"So, the difference between an officer and enlisted member, they kind of meld together once you get higher in superiority but the real difference is when you start. An E1 or an E2 seaman or airman, basically their only goal, their only purpose in life is to do a technical job whereas an officer, an ensign, his day one is actually managing a group of people. Obviously, they're both training but the goal of what they're supposed to do is slightly different. As you get higher, as you get to become E5, 6 or 7 for enlisted or you become a lieutenant, that's an O3 for an officer, then you start going into management and supervising people. So, at least on the ship, you would see that the E7s, the Chiefs and O3s, the lieutenants are working side by side, pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks, then enlisted is technical, officers are management.",What makes an officer different?,How are officers and enlisted persons different?,Is being an officer easier or harder than being an enlisted person?,What is enlisted?,What is an officer?,,,,,JobSpecific,Navy,How do you spend most of your time on deployment?,"So, deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes. Most of the time you're working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people, they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much all day.",What do you do on deployment?,What is your role on deployment?,How is work different on deployment?,What are your responsibilities on deployment?,,,,,,"Lifestyle, JobSpecific",Navy,What did you do during your off time while deployed?,"During your off time, while you're deployed, you have a couple things that you can do. So, I remember, personally I would always go play poker and steal people's money even though you're not supposed to but we'd find some ways to, you know, have fun with each other. We would trade, like coke bottles or trade cigarettes. Some people smoked, I didn't, but I'd still, you know, like be in the middle of trading things for cards. I also watched a lot of DVDs. So, we had an MWR, a morale recreation and welfare program where you have a choice of maybe 200 or 300 DVDs. You just tell them that's the one that you want and then you can watch it on, if you have your own personal DVD player or a laptop. I'd also just go out there on the fantail and just watch the ships go by, you know, ships go by and jets go by and maybe for going along the coast, just look at the beautiful country that we're going beside.",What do you do in your free time while deployed?,What do you do for fun while deployed?,What do you do when you aren't working while deployed?,How is life when deployed?,,,,,,"Lifestyle, JobSpecific",Navy,How do you spend most of your time off deployment?,"So, when you're not deployed, life is actually pretty good. So, the military comes in waves. Our hard time is when we go on deployment. That's when you give it your all, that's when you're working the hardest but when you come back then they kind of go easy on you. So, well actually, I was living in San Diego. This is an example from when I was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight the rush hour traffic. I think they began at six and then noon, that's when we normally have our lunch but they just send us home. So, days are cut short at six hours and so you just like, actually it's five hours because the traffic is the thing that cuts most of the morning. So, days are from seven to noon and then you split and go home and go see your family. So, you have a lot more time sometimes when you get off deployment.",What is work like off deployment?,What is your role off of deployment?,What are your duties off deployment?,How is work different off deployment?,,,,,,JobSpecific,Navy,Describe the work you do on a typical day.,"The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours. The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed, you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have another part of training where you just open up a book and review some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators, making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment on the ship.",What is a regular day like?,What is a typical day like in the Navy?,What do you do on a normal day?,What are you daily responsibilities?,,,,,,"Background, Lifestyle",,What are you doing now that you aren't active duty Navy?,"Now that I'm not in the active duty Navy, I joined the US Navy Reserves and I've been there for about the last eight years. So, that job isn't extremely difficult. They say that it's two days per month, two weeks per year and I've actually worked a lot more than that but it's a minimal time in the military. So, I've had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted to. I've split it between working at jobs. For instance, my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and I find little pieces of jobs here and there. So, I'm a part of a start-up. A computer science start-up working with virtual reality. I also go to school. So, I'm a full-time master's student when I'm back in America and I am studying game development.",What are you doing now?,What are you doing now that you are out of the Navy?,What is life like out of the Navy?,How has your life changed out of the Navy?,,,,,,Money,Navy,How much do you earn working for the Navy?,"So, your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people really love about working for the military. Right now, I'm a Chief, so I make about $4500 per month. Well, I don't make it, I am in the US Navy Reserve but usually on active duty, Chiefs make $4500 per month and they also have this thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing which almost doubles your paycheck. So, you get about like $2500 per month and if you add that up it's about $75000 per year.",What is your pay?,What is Navy pay?,What is your salary?,How much money do you make?,How much money do people make in the Navy?,Will the Navy pay me enough?,,,,JobSpecific,Navy,How many hours do you work in a typical day?,"The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays. Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days, if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours or six hours.",What are your hours like?,What are your work hours?,How much do you work while in the Navy?,How many hours do you work?,,,,,,"JobSpecific, STEM",Navy,What types of problems do you deal with on a daily basis?,"Problems show up every now and then. When you're on active duty, so it kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not. If you're deployed, that means things happen, you know, with any mechanical equipment. So, pumps could break in the middle of the night and then you get waken up and, you know, you have to go fix it. Sometimes you have people that come in drunk, on the weekends and when we were in port, so you'd have to make sure that, like, to get to their bed safely and that they get disciplined later on. Things like that happen on deployment.  When you are not deployed, then you still hear the drunk people coming in, you know, but because you're not, the ship isn't being used over and over and over every single day in and out, problems with the equipment doesn't happen as much. So, you just do preventive maintenance, which means that even though this pump looks fine, you're just going to open it up and check to make sure that the oil is there, and you know, that is at the right temperature and shut it. So, a lot easier time.",What are problems you solve?,How do you solve problems at work?,What are the issues you have to resolve being in the Navy?,What problems do you see regularly?,Do you run into problems?,,,,,"Lifestyle, Culture",Navy,What kind of issues are there with alcohol in the Navy?,"So, you probably heard of the term 'drunken sailors' and that's for a good reason. Once you are deployed and you pull into a port, which is like a little city of a new country, then the people are very very antsy and they want to get out and, you know, party a little bit. So, you probably been on the ship, in the middle of the ocean, you haven't seen another, you know, non-military soul for about a month. So, they really want to go out there and, you know, like, you know, do the opposite of what they were doing which is being disciplined. Now, they want to, you know, go be young kids. The military's basically eighteen to twenty four year olds. So, kind of like the college life. So, they go out there and do college level things. They find the first bar, they sit with each other and just, you know, find, you know, the cheapest alcohol and you could find them there the whole entire day and then they come back to the ship. The military knows this, so they have people walking around, checking into the bars, making sure they aren't caught causing fights, which they are, make sure that people aren't, you know, drinking too much which they are, make sure that people can make it home safely, you know, which means that they come back by taxi, which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes but it's all in good fun. By the time we leave, out of five thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there, you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real big trouble. I personally didn't, I personally wasn't involved in that drunk culture so much. I actually liked to go out to the town and explore, you know, the museums and the scenery and things like that but I had a few drinks myself too.",Is alcohol an issue?,Can you drink in the Navy?,Are there alcoholics in the Navy?,Do Navy sailors drink a lot?,What happens when sailors get too drunk?,,,,,Lifestyle,Navy,What is the Navy doing to combat heavy alcohol use?,"As soon as you join the military, probably your very first week, even though you're at bootcamp, so you have no access to alcohol but from that time,you know, all the way up until you end your career, you're going to be hearing about alcohol, alcohol responsibility, the fact that you can't drink too much, the fact that, you know, alcohol ruins people's lives and it's a very big thing for our culture. So, the Navy takes some strides to kind of change this. We get lots of training. We get, for instance, when we go to ports, when we're on deployment, we have this thing called the 'buddy system', which means that you're not allowed to go out yourself. You actually have to tap one of your friends and the both of you go out to explore this new city. They want to make sure that you don't go out there and get yourself into trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger, you know, guide you back to the ship. There are people who would rob you, there are people who will, you know, do harm to you. So, the 'buddy system' is probably the Navy's biggest way to combat alcohol misuse.",How is alcohol regulated?,How does the Navy deal with alcohol abuse?,What does the Navy do about alcohol?,Lifestyle,,,,,,"Lifestyle, Colleagues",Navy,How much did your friends impact where you ended up in your career?,"So, from the day that you join the Navy, you're going to find that you have similar past to people that are in your same field. So, you know, there are people who are very motivated and want to become the Master Chief of the Navy. You have some people who, maybe were criminals before and joined the military to prevent going to jail, to be given a shot for normal life before they winded up in a bad place. So, you have the whole gamut of people and different career paths, different intelligence, different motivations for being in the military. So, in general, people of a similar quality tend to hang out with the same people. So, people who like to drink all the time, you'll find that they're, you know, have this one house that they always go to, over and over. People that are very very motivated study all the time. You'll find that they probably share a house with people who want to become an officer. So, you also find that that's very apparent in the ports that you go to. So, for me, I didn't want to. I wasn't a drinker at that time. Not, not very much. So I'd go into port and I try to tap people like, ""Hey, do you want to go see some place fun?"", ""Do you want to go climb a mountain or visit a castle?

So, when you are painting that wall, you don't really see how that is actually helping you win the war in Afghanistan but it does. So, the higher you get in your enlisted pay grade, the more you see that big picture. I'm an E7, so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the civilians, make sure that this aircraft carrier runs fine and I think as officers, the higher you get, if you're a captain, you make sure that this aircraft carrier fits in this realm of the region so that, like we have power over there, we can dominate our foes.

So, it's not a nine to five job normally. When I was active duty and I wasn't on deployment and I was just stationed at my command, you still work many many cases during night time.

They have to do more sea tours, so you get to a point where you want to actually live the civilian life that you see many other people are experiencing. So, by the time your six years is up or four years, in some cases, is up, that's a pretty big milestone for you to make for your career and the turnover can be pretty sharp.

So, for instance, an O1, O2, O3, they're told by the higher level people who they're supposed to be managing, ""You're supposed to be tagging along with these people"", or I think for Officers, their main goal is just to be, to train themselves.

I joined when I was 21 and I didn't really have that many skills available to me. I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, an on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like a semi-regular life. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician. We weren't really allowed to do that because you're a nuke, you have to stay on the continental United States, So, I couldn't visit, I couldn't be stationed in Germany, I couldn't be stationed in France, which, you know, really, was irritating for me. And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, ""You know what? Electrician's Mate is really cool. It's one of the best jobs that you can have in the military.

You can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military, you might see someone in these, in this uniform, but in a very very movie style picture. And it's not always like that. For the most part, we're not soldiers. I'm not a soldier, I'm a sailor which is different than what many people think of the military. When you think, when many people think of the military, they think of a full-metal jacket, you know, with your hard hat, your helmet and, you know, walking around with a gun and to tell you the truth, I've never, you know, picked up a machine gun. The best I got was, like a little laser pointer in bootcamp. Otherwise, I've never, I've never seen a gun. So, the real military is a wide range of jobs. You have people working on the weapon system, you have people talking languages, you have people down in the nuclear plants, you have people that are cooks, you have people showing the jets how to move. But, what's really presented, what's romanticized is the basic soldier, you know, the Army style, the Marine style. So, the Navy's kind of different, in a good way.",What is exaggerated about the Navy?,What do people think is good about your job that really sucks?,How is your job worse than what people think?,,,,,,,Culture,Navy,What makes the Navy different than other branches of the military?,"The Navy is different than other branches in a lot of different ways but I think, about the second or third year that I was in the military, that I was in the Navy, I saw it as four different types, maybe five if you considered the Coast Guard. So, if you want to be the soldier that you hear about in the movies, then you join the Marines. They work out a lot more, they're the first people that start to fight the war. You have to, you know, be pretty strong and pretty brave, in the other branches too but more so for the Marines. If you want to be similar to the Marines but you want the tough lifestyle, you want the, you know, the rough, rugged fighting but you're more mechanically oriented, then you can try the Army. So, the Army, that's when you drive in tanks, that's when you set up communication systems in the middle of the desert. So, they're kind of Marines but they're not the first ones out there. If you want a, kind of, more civilian style job, then you join the Air Force. Air Force is known that you, it's known that you have some of the best equipment. For instance, at Travis Air Force Base, they have excellent golf clubs. They have, you have basically, a nine to five job. You can, kind of, sit in office many times. It's not always that case. You know, you can find lots of different jobs in any service but this is what was going on in my mind in the second year that I was in the Navy. So, the Navy is different from all of those. So, for instance, when you're on deployment, when you're six months, when you're traveling around in the middle of the ocean for six months, it's not like you're working out every day, also it's not a nine to five job in an office because you're working pretty much like, the whole day, you know, and it's not in an air conditioned office. It's sometimes down in the middle of the plants. The thing that the Navy has going for it is that you should be very technical. You should know your job better than any of your civilian counterparts. So, if you want to be known as someone who's like, pretty bright with when it comes to computers, when it comes to mechanical components, fixing machines, then the Navy is for you.","How does the Navy differ from the Army, Air Force and Marines?",Are the other services like the Navy?,Do the other services compare with the Navy?,How is the Navy different from other services?,,,,,,Misconceptions,Navy,What are some of the common misconceptions about your field?,"Some of the common misconceptions about being in the Navy, well, the biggest one I hear is, well, ""How often do you swim?"" and I'd say, ""I can't even swim"" and they're like ""What?

I didn't really know that much about the military. My father was in the army and I should have had a better clue than what I did but I never, you know, I barely visited when he was in the army. He just came home and then, you know, took care of us. So, I had that same understanding that most people think about when they hear about them, the military, that is, that you're going to put on the hat, you're going to wear these clothes,you're going to, you know, go to foreign countries and fight wars. So, I did fight wars but I never really visited the country itself. My war was on a ship itself, on an aircraft owned by America. So, I didn't ever go to Iraq, I didn't ever go into Iran, I didn't ever go to Saudi Arabia. I didn't go to those places but I still fought the war, so that's kind of different than what I was expecting. I also bought into the mentality that everyday is going to be like P.T, physical training, good for you, good for me, but you barely work out. You are supposed to keep in shape. So, if you get overweight, then, you know, that could be a problem but for the Navy at least, as long as you meet the standards in the training which happens every six months, they make sure that you're not overweight, that you can do some push-ups and some sit-ups, then you're good to go and some people actually, they kind of skate around the system.

They'd say, you know, ""Just go to your bed"" or ""We'll see you later"". It depends on whether you're on deployment or whether you're stationed at home but you might have to work, maybe one or two hours extra every other day. However, as I progressed, when I became an E6, which is a first class or a Chief which is an E7, then, after that normal work day of telling people what to do, you know, you're there the same exact time as they are, you have to do, like, the follow up at the end. So, for instance, they get done at the end of the day. So, now that you have that information, while they get to go home or they get to, like, you know, have that downtime, you have to go report that to other people. You have to do the paperwork that other people are requiring. So, you have to wait till the normal work is done and then you have to add on the supervisory specialization that you have to give at the very very end.

The first way is, that I understand the different roles of the military now. Before, I just thought we were just one big group, you go fight a war and I didn't know who did what but now, I see where we stand globally as far as, like, what branches do what service. Aircraft people, they stay pretty much on United States soil and then they send huge ships to do logistics. Marines, they're the ones who keep in really good shape so that they can go and get that first push when we start the war, when we start a battle. We have the Army people who like, provide support to the Marines and they fight themselves too, you know, but they're the ones like, shooting guns and stuff. So, like, you start to learn all of these things and later on, as a supervisor, you get more information about why we are doing things. So, for instance, why we're fighting in Iraq, why we are sending these planes over there and how the aircraft carrier can support them as opposed to like, when you're, you know, fresh on this ship, like, I don't know, I'm just here on this boat. I'm supposed to fix that pump, that's all I know.

So, I got to visit the four corners of America and I got to see the different lifestyles. So, I grew up in Alabama which is, like, down south in a black community. Everybody around me, my neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint, Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side. So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see, you know, it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot, well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country, you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change.

I would say that it's a little bit of both. Now, there's some psychology here. I do believe that when you're born, you have certain innate abilities, comes from your mom and your dad, comes from your race. Some of us are different skinned, some of us are taller or shorter, some of us are, you know, stronger based on your genes and I also think that, like, your mind is, it follows the same trait, you know, like everybody's different. Some people are artists when they're born, some people are engineers when they're born. However it depends on how you grow up. So, you can take someone who's an artist as a kid and then you can train them through their lives to become a great engineer. Now, maybe they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their bodies but they can do a good job, a great job in fact. So, it's a combination of both. It depends on who your mom and your dad were. Hopefully, you got that training, whatever training that you want to be and later on in your life but if you don't, the military, who realizes this, can train anybody to do anything.

I didn't know anything about physics, like, for instance, I didn't know like, what happened with gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some common things that I would have gotten wrong but because I took those college classes, that helped me prepare myself better to do well in A school. Because I did well in A school that, you know, like, set me off on a big career path later on. But it's not just like, nuclear technician, it could be, for instance, electronics technician. You might want to brush up on some of your voltage and your current and your resistors. You could be a cook. You might want to brush up on, like, the different specialties of the flavors that you're going to be using or you know, ask some other cooks out there, like, ""What does it take to be good at my job?""

Now, no one's going to say, well, ""You know, President, you are the one that caused that entire city to be downgraded."" It wasn't his job, you know, like, maybe it's the President before him. However, he takes responsibility for it. So, there's a lot of responsibility taking for things that you don't directly control but because it was under your guidance, you are the one that, who people look to, whether it was your fault or not. So, if for instance, my military unit has many people that aren't physically fit, then they're going to say, ""Chief, what is wrong with your unit?"" Now, I don't have any excuse. I could say, well, ""You know, I tell them to work out and they just don't listen."" I could grab them by the collar and like, try to run with them but in the end, the people that are working for you, it's their, it's under their cognizance and you just take responsibility for it. So, is that fair?

It can be very easy for them, they understand the math that's involved, they understand how how the physics works, how to tie the knot. But for some people it could be the first time that they've ever seen it in their lives. Maybe they've never even been on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them. So, the cool thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that you need, hands down. So if you don't need it then you probably won't use it but if you do need it then it's all a matter of asking a chief ""Hey where can I get help"" or a matter of going to your local library and getting that book. The biggest thing is that there's gonna be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job.

So they make sure that whether it's tying a knot or painting a ship or it's going down and fixing the pump they're gonna make sure that you can complete your job and if there's any question to it then they're not gonna allow you to do it so.",Can I move up?,Does everybody have a chance to get promoted?,Is there always something new to learn and master?,,,,,,,Management,Navy,How satisfied have you been with your bosses in your career?,"The bosses that I've had in the navy have been varied. Some of them I've got along with greatly but others they- in many cases it it depends on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone, somtimes you make friends sometimes you make enemies if you can say that. So most people are just somewhere in the middle so the people that you would have a beer with in real life, those the people you can joke around with, those are the people that understand your personality and they're the ones who respect your work the best. However I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political, so for instance you could have a work center that has like four or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know two or three people in the unit. So the quiet person who barely ever talks to that supervisor could get frustrated in the fact that his work isn't being recognized the way that it should. So I've had that personal problem too. But it is what it is. You just take an average of your whole entire career. Sometimes you will be a superstar and sometimes you are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list. But for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll be successful. I made it to chief, so it seems like most of what I've been doing with my bosses has been on the positive side.",Is you leadership competent?,Are officers helpful or are they pests?,Do people senior to you screw with you all the time?,,,,,,,"STEM, JobSpecific",Navy,Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.,"So some of the technology that I worked on in my career as a nuclear technician, it's kind of divided into two parts because the nuclear technology field is divided into two parts. The first one is electrical things, I'm an Electrician's Mate, so I used many components like a watt meter, a volt meter, oscilloscope these are all equipment that you use to touch things around the plant to get readings on them. See what their oil level is, see what they're voltage is, see what the current is, see what the power is. So they're really used all throughout America as electricians as use them. The other part of my job, the nuclear technology field, is very specific most of the time. But if you think of Homer Simpson, he was a nuclear technologist. It only deals with things that the uranium cycle can do to make power. So some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run. So for instance it makes electricity. So for instance I worked with turbine generators. The nuclear technology of the aircraft carrier makes steam, so the steam will power lots of different things all around the ship. So all of the valves that it takes to make sure that the steam goes to the right places, so that a spin pumps, or to move the screws of the aircraft carrier so that it can move through the water. All of those are things I dealt with as far as technology.",What is the technology around you every day?,Do you work with a lot of technical equipment?,Do you work with fancy gear or just regular tools?,Do you work in a lab or on-site?,,,,,,"STEM, Future",,What is your opinion on nuclear energy and its future?,"With nuclear energy, maybe because I have a bias because I went through the program but what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe. It's one of the safest ways to make energy that we have. Now there is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we have nuclear waste at the end of an aircraft carrier's life cycle, but it's controlled in a certain spot and we put in the middle of the ground as opposed so let's say charcoal which produces fumes in the air as opposed to sunlight which doesn't provide the energy for the surface area that it has , to produce as much as the nuclear power that is. As opposed to wind which requires these big things in far off places. So nuclear technology can be built anywhere in a safe manner, and in fact the navy has a history of zero incidents of nuclear failures in the navy's history, so we're really proud of that. I think that nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future energy needs; however, I do understand people's hesitation with taking on nuclear power, especially with the thing that happened in Japan-the great Japanese earthquake in 2001. So it's been a big problem to try to pick up all of the all the pieces there. They still have problems with it, even though it has been you know like eight years later. However that took a huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day, so whether it's charcoal whether it's sunlight you know no matter what, when you have a big earthquake like that then that is going to happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make energy that I know of, and that's what we are taught.",Do you think this field will be around for years or go away?,Are you happy working in this field?,Don't you think this work is dangerous to everyone?,,,,,,,Culture,Navy,What organizations were most helpful to you in your career?,"The organizations most helpful to me number one has to be the military healthcare system so I think I hurt my thumb I also sprained my foot really bad and one thing that you don't really have to worry about being in the military is the top of this head to the bottom of your feet- it's all taken care of. You might have to pay a little bit more for your family but other than that the rates are really cheap and it's very convenient. Another thing that I think of, another association I think of when I think of the military that is actually on the fun level is MWR. Without MWR I would have a hugely different impression of the military but they throughout my whole entire career if I ever wanted to play pool, if I ever wanted to bowl, if I ever wanted to go hiking, skiing, camping, they were right there with super friendly people to make sure that our work outside of our hard military life is rewarded. And finally I have to give my credit to the USO. Whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest people. They give me hot dogs, cakes, cookies, they provide me a place to sleep, they allow me to put my bags down, especially when I want to walk around the aircraft carrier without being over burdened. I see other people out there waiting in these long lines, back up against the wall with the kids and then I see the USO people and their military families having the time of their lives even though it's a five hour flight. So hats off to USO.",What organizations are important to your work?,Do you have a professional society?,Should I join any professional groups?,,,,,,,Jargon,Navy,What is MWR?,"MWR stands for morale, recreation, and welfare. That's basically the military's leisure association, you go in there you can ask them anything from hiking equipment, camping equipment, maybe they can show you a place to shoot guns. If you're in a foreign country they can tell you all the different places around that you can enjoy yourself. So for instance in San Diego, they told us where Disneyland is, Seaworld, how to go to Mexico safely, how to go to Las Vegas, all the things that are around San Diego. They also give you cheaper rates than civilians can get. So basically if you're in any place that has MWR that's the first place to go when you want to try to do something fun out in the community.","What does morale, welfare and recreation do?",Who takes care of your having a good off-duty life?,Is MWR a Navy organization?,,,,,,,Jargon,Navy,What is USO?,"USO stands for the United Services Organization. I don't specifically know like why they were formed but I I know that a lot of people who are associated with the military before, maybe they're veterans themselves, maybe it's the wife of someone in the military, maybe it's someone who just has a lot of respect for the military. They come and they volunteer their time to show their respect to the military in lots of ways. The way that I know is that they're at airports and they have a little building off to the side or maybe they're on the second level of the airport where you can go in and you can rest, you can eat some of their food, you can have conversations with other people on similar flights, and it's really convenient. I'm sure that they do other things as well so I wanna give them credit for that but the way that I know them is from their support at the airports.",Is USO the group that puts on shows for GIs and Sailors?,What does USO stand for?,Is USO part of your life?,,,,,,,"Risk, JobSpecific",Navy,What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?,"You might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you can be, and when you do that, when you want to try to do that, that means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy. So it all began when I joined the join the military. At first I had the opportunity to take normal jobs, slightly higher jobs, and in their most advanced field, nuclear technology. So that's what I chose to do. I didn't take the easy route in that case and for me it worked out really well. As I became a nuclear technician then lots of jobs start popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to have an easy life, have a normal nine to five job. Do I want to go home at the end of the night or should I try this supervisory position that you hear that they have to stay on the ship later, they have more responsibly put on them, they're blamed a lot more for things. So basically you have to make your life worse some people would say, but I think it's just more responsible. Just like with any job the more responsibility you take, the more risks you have of getting in trouble now because you're taking care of this work center your blamed for that work center if something goes wrong. However if you can do your good job and have that work center be better because of you. You tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of failure you bring your boss down there and say well this is the way it used to be but I told this person to do X, this person to do Y and now this person is better because of that. So now that supervisor that's in front of you will give you an award for that so the only way to progress yourself, to become a chief, senior chief, master chief, is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure and ultimately reap the rewards.",Is this dangerous?,Do you sometimes have to take chances?,Has this job ever made you feel insecure?,,,,,,,"Education, Growth/learning, Advice",Navy,Should I go to college before or after serving?,"I went to college after I did the military. I think that's one way to do it, but you have a wide range of opportunities for college. If you ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends on what you wanna do. If you wanna have a very good enlisted career, and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you join the military right away. Officers need a college degree, so if you get the college degree first then you can become an officer as soon as you join the military. You can apply to become an officer and every year thereafter, however you probably wouldn't start your career four years later. So that could be a hindrance if you wanna have a full enlisted career. For people that aren't sure what the what they want to do, I still suggest that they join the military right away because you can go to school while you're in the military. I took a few classes myself. So if you decide that college isn't for you then you didn't waste those four years. Also military college can be free in many cases. It can be very very cheap, they have the tuition assistance that can reduce the price by a few thousand dollars or ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during your off time. So that means you can kill two birds with one stone, you can get the work experience and you can do college at night time. For some people like me, I didn't want the military work to interfere with my school. I wanted to get As, so that's why even though I wanted to go to school the entire time that I was in the military, I waited until I got out so I could use the Montgomery GI Bill, so I could go to a very expensive university, and so that I could really focus on my school without worrying about work in the middle. So between going to school in the beginning if you want to become an officer, going to school during your career if you're thinking about making the military a career itself, or doing college at the very end, so you can enjoy the Montgomery GI Bill, the post 9-11 benefits, and all the free stuff.

So America spends I think six hundred billion dollars per year, which is from what I understand several times more than any other country. It's maybe the next six countries combined total, that's what the military spends. So what are we using that money for I would say that it's policing the world. We make sure that we have a huge military so that there aren't huge fights breaking out all over the world like it used to be two hundred three hundred years ago because there wasn't a main force. Then you have England attack France, Iraq attack Saudi Arabia, I'm making up countries but you understand that there wasn't a global force for good making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all the attacking. So yes America does attack itself too and there's an ideology behind that.

I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up to two thousand dollars.

That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it.

So for instance you could have water going in this direction and then you maybe turn a switch or apply some, some setting to a control mechanism that separates it into different, different paths. So let's say need a little bit of water and you have a lot of water over here then you regulate it so that only a little bit flows out. But let's say you need lots of water here, then you regulate it so that there's lots of water that comes out. So the same thing happens with an electrician, my job. We have voltage regulators so let's say you have a pump that needs twenty volts and you have a machine that can provide all of that, you just don't wanna pump all of the current from that machine into that little, little box, right. So you have a regulator that provides the right voltage so that that voltage will just allow the correct current to go through that machine.

So for instance if I knew about like, that the nuclear technology field dealt with the internals of making nuclear power with uranium, then I would study more about that, and my schooling would had a better, I would've understood my schooling a lot better. If I would have picked up a little bit of electrician knowledge beforehand, like for instance, I had no idea what the difference between voltage and current was until I was midway in my A school, my initial school learning. So it would be really nice if I would have understood some of those basic concepts before I started the school. My grades would have been higher, I would have gotten more awards, maybe I would've understood the material, the complex material that was being presented to me in a much, in a much better way if I would've had like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand.

I wasn't an engineer person per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages, and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff, and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well, you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well, you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to know more about it.

However, some of computer science is really really easy I know that some people who had never done computers at all, can you know study for a week or two, and then put things on the computer like web design or something. So then based on what they learn over the next like a few weeks they can actually make a career out of that, and that's computer science as well.

Once I got to my first ship it would probably be the chiefs and the senior chiefs who kind of gave me at least some kind of motivation to be like them. They didn't really teach me, well I didn't get the advice from the things that they showed me, but it's more like the way to be a chief, the way to be in the military you know. That part is like more valuable for me wanting to stay in the military and keep in the military rather than like this is how you charge an electrical device or something like that so. After I got out of the military, I actually was looking more towards the people not even in the military. So I'm in USC's, University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies, and I've gotten a lot of really good advice for my military career from people who aren't even in the military themselves. Just because they have, they understand what it takes to be in the military and where the future of the military lies.

They say, ""If you choose to, you're allowed to find an apartment out in the world and we'll give you money for it."" In other locations if you're second class petty officer, then they might allow you to stay in the houses on base. Especially if you are in a foreign country, then, you know, you'll probably be staying on base. As you get a lot higher in rank, like, for instance if you're a chief or a senior chief, master chief or if you're an officer, then they probably give you lots of cash and they allow you to, like, find a much bigger house.

Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City, but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for you so it's a very quiet town.

Not your job, I'll always be an Electrician's Mate, but your roles throughout your career, they understand that they can't just put somebody on a boat you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire. He'll go crazy, right? So after your tour of maybe four years, then they provide you some opportunities to do different type of work. So they can send you to a shore command, let's say in San Diego where you can kinda like just chill at one of the facilities there, no boats, just a nine to five job. They also, they offered me to go to Italy to work on a sub tender, which is kinda like being on a little boat, you get lots of port calls and stuff so that's one opportunity to go overseas, but if you do like four years on an aircraft carrier, then a couple more years on another boat, that's a lot of sea time. So that was one opportunity for me. They also had another aircraft carrier that was stationed in Japan, it was called the USS Kitty Hawk. However it like, that's where I was going to go, I was in camp like let you know four places in America or send me to Japan? I'm going to Japan, that's where I'm going to go you know, but nah unfortunately we weren't able to go on that.

So once you join the military you get some kinds of incentives to join, so being a nuclear technician we're allowed to become E3s immediately. But in boot camp everyone's E1. So as soon as boot camp ended, then I was promoted to a fireman, which is the the engineering side of E3 right, and I did that for school, I was in school for six months, and by the time I graduated that school after six months, I was promoted to a first class petty officer, which is E4. Then I was, I went to nuclear power school, and then prototype training. They're both six months and six months, then I went to my first ship. Now when I finally got to my first ship, that's when I had been in for two years and also because of my rate, nuclear technician, they offered us to automatically be promoted to second class petty officer, that's E5. And that's what I did, they offered us some cash, I got forty thousand dollars in cash, and it was tax free because we were fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to E5. So up until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically promoted either by school or just by joining, or just by signing a contract for an additional two years. That automatic promotion to E5 was because I extended my contract from six years to eight years. After that time, after that two years, then I was, I got promoted four years later to E6. So I was promoted E5 in 2002 promoted E6 in 2006, and then I guess I spent two more years in the military, and then I got out after eight years as an E6, which is first class petty officer. Then I made chief, which is what I am now, E7 in 2010, so that's four more years after. So again the time line is I joined boot camp, that's E1, after boot camp, which is about three months, then I was E3, a year and a half later I was, I'm sorry six months later I was E4, at my two year point I was an E5, and then four years later I was an E6, and four more years after that I was E7, chief.",how have you advanced in the Navy?,tell me about you ranks or rates in the Navy.,can you characterize your career path?,how have you progressed in rank?,how did you get to be a chief?,,,,,"Military, Money",Navy,What was your salary throughout your Navy service?,"So my salary obviously it changes every time I get promoted.

So right now I'm a chief and it depends on which, which city you live in, which is gonna dictate your BAH your basic allowance for housing, but everybody makes the same basic pay. So my basic pay right now is $4,500 per month, if I were to be active active duty service, and I also get another couple thousand dollars are for my BAH which is the money that they give you for housing. So all in all it's about $75,000 per year with 16 years in. A person who just barely comes in, he's not going to get, he or she is not going to get that BAH. They will probably just be living on a ship or something like that, and as far as the basic pay, it's probably just a couple thousand dollars maybe $3,000 when you talk about outside of boot camp. So it's about $35,000 to start.

You have the enlisted and you also have the officers. Officers are people who have been to college, who have a degree, and who have been awarded a commission, which means their job is to take care of people, their job is to have a command underneath them. So the people that they hire are called the enlisted people. Enlisted people just have to have a college degree or, sorry not college degree, a high school degree or a GED, and then you're able to join the military. You're sent to a vocational school, it's called A school, and from that time then you are actually like the performer, the technical person, the person who drives the ship, or the person who makes the pump, or the person who checks the voltage. So the officers are the people in charge, the enlisted people are the ones who do it. So the enlisted people have a ranking from E1 to E9. An E1 is, it could be, well there are three types. There are the people that deal with aircraft things, people who deal with ship type things, and then people who are engineers. So the engineers are called firemen, the ship type people are called seamen, and the airforce jet type people are called airmen. So there's airmen recruit, then you go airman apprentice, and then you have just a regular airman for E3. That's E1, E2, and E3. After that, E4, E5, and E6, those are called petty officers, so E4 is called third class petty officer, E5 is second class petty officer, and E6 is first class petty officer. And then you have three more which is are chiefs. So I'm an E7 which is a chief and they have a slightly different emblem for their uniform. They're all gold and you can see that this is an anchor. So if you just have this, that's a chief, if you have a star right here that's a E8, that's a senior chief. If you have two stars right here, that's a master chief. So again, E1, E2, E3, petty officer, third class, second class, and first class, and then chiefs: chief, senior chief, master chief.

O4 is Lieutenant Commander. O5 is Commander.O6 is a Captain and Captains are the ones, they're basically really really high in their officer community. They're the people that command the ship, command the aircraft carrier, those are Captains. After that, then you have people who have been Captains for a long time and they're super senior people that you see on TV, those are the Admirals. So you have Rear Admiral Lower Half, Upper Half, Vice Admiral and Admiral.

So like no matter what it is, they'll have a lot of complaints but I realize, I grew up in Flint, Michigan you know, so the fact that they gave me a nice clean bed with clean furniture and a desk right there you know, and that's all they give, and a closet you know. It looks like a tiny little hotel you know, like kind of a cheap hotel, but for me that's you know and the fact that it's free like really blew my mind away. So the other place that you can stay at, for instance the Navy Gateway Inn, or the Navy lodge, they're some of the highest quality hotels that you can find. For instance I was in Hawaii a couple of years ago and I stayed at like this expensive like $300 hotel, and it was nice you know there's a bed, king size bed and you know. But then you stay at the Navy lodge down the street and it's like a huge room with nice fans and there's like, the bedroom has its own door. The bathroom is like you can swim in it, you know you go outside and there's like three couches and there's like TVs for every room, it's crazy. It has its own separate kitchen so like they realize that you know the military people that are traveling across the country, they need a nice place to stay. So it's some of the best places that I've stayed at. Now the place that the military provides for the sailors, it's very quaint.

So I say that the common crime is drinking alcohol, but that's not a crime in itself. The other things are kind of collateral damage, so yeah if you're on a ship for a year, then you will see that somebody has robbed, one person on the ship has robbed somebody out there in the world, you will hear about four fights, five fights that got people demoted, and you will hear about three drunk driving's.

So if we're about to fight a war, or if we're in the middle of a war, then you can expect that they're trying to increase the size of the military, and for that then they provide a bonus. If there, if it's kinda peacetime or if they're downsizing the Navy, then obviously they offer less. So it's a size shaping tool that the Navy has to get people to come in and leave. With that said, in most cases for their advanced jobs, they almost always have some kind of incentive. It ranges in the amount, but it's there nonetheless. So the amount that I received, they gave me the choice, they said I could have $12,000 in cash, you know minus taxes, or you could have a really big educational bonus. It was $50,000. So I knew I was going to go to college and I wanted to make sure that I didn't you know like spend the money early so I said give me the educational bonus at the end. A lot of people that I knew like I guess the first year I was in you know, people had new cars they put down payments on like nice musical equipment and stuff like that. So some other jobs that you could have that provide bonuses, are obviously a lot of the STEM jobs. So there's Electrician's Mate, that's not inside the nuclear field but just regular electricians. There's Fire Controlmen FC's. So those are the ones who fix like all of the, from the engineering plants up. That mean's like the top part of the ship, not dealing with the nuclear side, just from engineering and up you know. They have to be pretty bright too, so they get bonuses. And Cryptological Technicians that learn languages, they're the spies, the ones who like listen, try to find out what foreign people are are up to, they get cash bonuses.

After you've been in for twenty years, then you're allowed to have retirement. At the end of your twenty years, you can either on say I would like to retire, or you can stay in up to thirty years. So every year that you're in you get to have two and a half percent longer than twenty years. At twenty years you get half of your basic pay, so this is what I mean. The Navy gives you lots of money while you're in based on certain things. Sixty percent of what you make is your basic pay, then you get a little more for sustenance, which is just the basic things that you need for your home. You also get a little bit more for if you're on a submarine or not. Also you get some more basic allowance for housing for your housing costs. But sixty percent of that is your basic pay. So the navy gives you half that at a twenty year point. I'm a chief, I make $4,500 per month so they give me half of that at twenty years. If I chose to stay in longer then the add on another two and a half percent, two and a half percent, two and a half percent. Depending on what I retire as, it can be up to thirty years, so at thirty years that'll be seventy five percent of your basic pay. Now because I'm a chief I make $4,500 per month, but they basically take your highest three months of earning, and that's the cost that that they provide you for your retirement.",how do you plan for getting out of the military?,what do you do when you retire from the Navy?,what benefits do retirees get?,what is Navy retirement?,,,,,,"Military, Opportunities, Resources",,Describe the hiring process.,"Whenever you want to join the military, then you have to go to one of the different service branches. So there's one in every major city, sometimes there are two. So you go into whichever one you feel you might most be fitted for. I actually tried to join the airforce at first, but I ended up in the Navy. There's gonna be somebody behind a desk that's going to you know say can you please have a seat, so why do you want to join? What kinds of things interest you? They'll ask lots of questions about like how did in high school, what your interests are, and see if you're a good fit. They're also trying to see if you have a kind of criminal background and if you seem maybe uncommitted, they'll probably push you to the side. But they want to give everybody a chance so after you have your initial conversation with him, he'll ask you to take a practice test. It could be right there at that same time. So the recruiter will guide you to another room and the test is kind of like a little mini scholostic achievement test, a mini SAT. It has a little bit of physics there, math there, a little bit of english there, just general things. So you don't have to be scared of the test, it's not a pass or fail. It's more like what types of jobs you can have. So you take the test and where you score he'll say he has a list of maybe sixty, seventy jobs these are the ones that you qualify for. If you don't qualify for the job you want, then you're allowed to practice a little bit more. He'll give you some resources that you can use to study. But by that time if you are decided on the type of job that you want, that you're willing to do, then he will take you to, he or she will take you to this thing called MEPS, it's military entrance processing place that you can go to with lots of other people who are interested in joining the military to take the real test. The real test is nice and quiet, it's a lot longer, it's very comprehensive, and that's when they can offer you the real job. They'll probably serve you some breakfast in the morning it's an all day thing, and assuming that you pass the test on that same day, they can also have, get you through medical at that time which means that they'll check your eyes, check your dental, make sure that you're physically fit to go through it, and maybe the entire recruiting process could take maybe a week, maybe even a couple of days I have heard. But for me it took several months. They have you in this thing called delayed entrance processing where you do your test, you figure out the job that you want and maybe you don't have to join the service until a good time for them, which could be like a year later or maybe after your high school, after you graduate high school or after you finish your job or something like that.",what is it like getting into this line of work?,how do I get a job in the Navy?,what is recruitment?,how do I get hired?,,,,,,"Training, Military",Navy,Describe the initial training.,"After you get done with your initial entrance processing for the military, then you're onward to boot camp. Boot camp is about three months, and they train you on simple things, tying knots, communicating with other people, how to do drill formations, things that you see in Full Metal Jacket. If you want to watch the first half of that movie then you understand what boot camp tries to be like. After that, then you're onward to your first vocational school, which is called A school. It ranges in size my school was six months, but it could be as short as two weeks. In general it's a couple months. After that time, then you're supposed to go off to your ship unless your in an advanced program like I was, in which case you'll go on to another school. My next school was a nuclear power school for another six months, and then after that I had prototype training, which means that they sent me to a real prototype to train on the real thing with people watching me, of course and that was six months. Then I went to my ship.",what was your initial career training like?,did someone show you the ropes?,were you sent to training when joining?,what are the first days at work like?,what is it like to join the Navy?,,,,,"Training, Military",Navy,What is boot camp like?,"Boot camp is the initial training that all military members go through. So you go to this place near the Chicago area and they put you in a division, it's about maybe thirty people or so. It's very very strict there. Everybody's in bunk beds and be teach you how to make your bed, but it's in a very special way. All the creases have to be aligned perfectly, all of the sheets have to be super clean and facing the same way. So it's not, when they teach you to make this bed, it's not the fact that they want you to make a bed this way, it's the fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions. They give you a list of steps and they make sure that number one you don't talk back to them, number two that you do it at the time that it is supposed to be done, at six o'clock or at five o'clock in the morning, with you standing outside of your bed with it already been made. They make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the bed, or that it's all made the same way. So there's a lot that goes into making this bed. So I'm mentioning this bed part because everything about boot camp is the exact same way, from the books that you train on, to the knots that you're making, to the way that you do your drills. It's not that they're trying to teach you these things, they are but they're actually filtering out who has no problem with following directions and who needs a little bit more time to train in these things, and for some reason like let's say you come from a bad neighborhood, you don't like being talked to and yelled at, those are people that would have problems if they go out into the real service. So they take those people to the side, maybe they're in boot camp for a little bit longer or maybe they actually get kicked out of boot camp. But by the time you get done with your three months or four months of boot camp, you should have a good idea of what discipline is like, and how to follow directions from the simplest of tasks to the more complex tasks.",did your military training go well?,tell me about recruit training?,did you have to learn to march?,what is boot camp?,is boot camp hard?,,,,,"STEM, Opportunities",,What are the different types of careers in computer science?,"Computer science is a really broad field so whether you like to work with your hands or whether you like to work with your mind, there's something for everybody. So for the people that like to get into the machine, you can do hardware, computer hardware, and that's when you open it up and you look at the motherboard, you check the voltage of it if you're going to be like fixing it. Or gonna try to figure out like how to design everything in a nice ten inch by eight inch little square you know, like so that it all fits. So how to put the USB in a certain spot. If you want to deal with the way that the computer looks, that could be like web design. There's this thing called Cascading Style Sheets where they make regular text like ""my name is Clint"" and you can make it like big, blue, bright, colorful and you know make it dancing all along the screen. So it doesn't take that much computer science knowledge to do web design, that's what's it's a really popular field for people who are just getting into computer science. Now if you're mathematically inclined then you can start thinking about the way that the letters dance on the screen, or the way that Marla jumps, or the way Marla being a video game character, or the way that an operating system like does the process that it's doing behind the scenes. So like let's say there's a little bit of math that goes into it, nothing too complex we're not dealing with calculus here but we are dealing with very, it's hard to describe, and when you think of computer scientist being smart then your thinking about programmers. Those are the ones who I'm talking about. Programmers are the ones who open up an application and they start typing inside and they tell the computer, computer listen to me can you please open this application and make this jump, and make this, when I press the enter key make sure that the program closes and another program opens, and this is the first word that shows up on the screen when I do this. So programmer are, they actually program the computer to work. Another thing is graphics, where this is the way that the light reflects from the computer. So you kind of think about the way that TV screens have looked throughout the ages. First they came in black and white, then they had a little bit of color, and then they had a lot more pizzazz and they're very very sharp now. TVs now, they look like real life people as opposed to like the blurry ones from before. So the people in graphics, they're the ones who constantly make sure that the programmers do the right code so that the computer knows how to do it really fast, and so that the light that reflects doesn't make the computer slow and that it looks really clear to the viewer. So those are several of the many computer science jobs that are available ranging from the really hardware based to the graphics to the programming to graphics, there are many more.",what are the subspecialties in CS?,are there different ways to do a computer science career?,what are the different paths you can take in a computer science career?,what can I do in the computer science field?,,,,,,"Advice, Resources, STEM",,Who do I talk to if I'm interested in this computer science?,"If you're thinking about becoming a computer scientist yourself, I would have to say that the first thing you should do is probably look online to find out about what different types of jobs there are and what it is they do. With a little bit of experience, with a little bit of browsing around on Google, you can kinda get an idea about it. But it they don't really tell you exactly what they do, so the next person would be probably someone in the field obviously. If you can find a NASA computer scientist then go for it you know, but any university student who's your junior, senior level, they have your basic programming skills they have your basic idea of what computer theory involves. So just asking a couple questions you know, whether it's been hard for them, whether anybody with a with a normal high school degree can kinda do this work, whether the job that they're doing is really really complex. It ranges so they might not be the guide you the best, but they can give you an idea of like kind of where you fit in, and whether it's a career that you want to try yourself.",what are good sources of information in CS?,are there people to whom I should talk about this career path?,who should I avoid talking to when considering this kind of work?,who can I get advice about CS from?,,,,,,"Military, Culture",Navy,What is dress attire in the Navy?,"Our uniform ranges a lot from clothes that you wear everyday like this, these are camouflage, this is a camouflage shirt that I'm wearing and matching pants and really hard, rock hard boots to make sure that you don't stub your toe. And you can go on up to your dress blues which is like when you're going to a very special occasion, maybe some kind of ceremony, that you need to look very presentable, you wouldn't work in your dress blues. So other uniforms that we wear, I wear khakis. Chiefs which is E7, E8, E9 and officers they've wear things call khakis, which is like a nice pressed uniform, it's brown with white instead of this blue, and matching pants. You can work in them but generally those are people that kind of oversee people working. The workers on the other hand they can wear these things called coveralls, which is it brings you back to your five year old days, which is like a one piece body suit. You can put one leg in, one leg in, put your arms in, then zip it all the way up and coveralls look like the things that people that change oil, their clothes, they wear. So if you think about someone changing your oil, he gets on that like sliding machine thing, then goes up under the car. That whole entire uniform is, that's what coveralls look like, and they're all blue, except they're for the Navy.",can you tell me when you wear which uniforms?,what do all the uniforms mean?,do you get different uniforms as you are promoted?,does the Navy buy all your uniforms?,do you always have to wear a uniform?,,,,,"Military, Culture",Navy,To what extent does the military adhere to tight schedules both long term and daily?,"Since you're going to be in the military, you have to make sure that you're on time for things. So if you show up late, then people will look at you ""Hey you know come on time next time."" You show up late twice then you get scolded, come late three times then chances are you could be sitting in front of a chief having him and other chiefs like come down on you, and you do it four times then you probably get written up with the counseling check, which means that like I said ""Hey like I told this guy it's a cause for being fired from the military so make sure that you don't do it again."" So yeah if that's not  your deal you know, you show up whenever you want, then you should erase that from your vocabulary because the Navy's pretty tight with their schedules.",are you time constrained in what you do every day or across your entire career?,is there any slack built into your work day?,how important is time management in the Navy?,Is it okay to be late?,,,,,,"Opportunities, Fit, Military",Navy,How can I request to work in a certain area or field?,"The field that you want to work in is specifically guided by how well you did on the test. So basically you rate. So it's very important to kind of, if you do want to work in a demanding field, to try to score as high as you can. If you don't get the job you want when you tried first tried, then before you join try to you know bump it up a little bit you know, to try to get that job. So once you're in the military, then there's gonna be a big range of jobs that you can do. You can work in the library, you can work you know with electrical components, at least for me as an Electrician's Mate I had a wide range of things that I could do. So if you're trying to ask which job I can do, which job can I apply for, a lot of it's kind of political. A lot of it's well you know like we've known him for a while, he's been on the ship for a long time so like he has a choice. Since you just come to the ship then like this is the only job that we have for you you know. You could be painting this deck or scrubbing this floor, right that's the job that we have for you. But if you've been in for a lot longer then you have a little bit of leeway in asking for jobs, and again you know within your rate, it depends on how high you score. So for instance there's going to be people who will be providing work to other people who are going to be writing it down, writing their job descriptions down and providing it. We need those people to be some of the brightest so if you don't have a good work history, then you might not be able to apply for for that job. So number one try to score as high as possible, and number two try to learn on the job as much as possible, and that's how you can get the best job that you want.",how likely is it that I will get to do what I want to do?,will the Navy assigned me to something I hate to do?,can I do another job if I don't like mine?,are jobs in the Navy permanent?,,,,,,"Military, Training, Challenges",Navy,What was the most difficult part of your training?,"The most difficult part of training I gotta say, it's probably the material, at least for nuclear technology. I wasn't a very good student. I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to learn the material myself. Like for instance one of the things that we learned is what grounds are you know, and it took me so long to figure out what a ground is, like ground they say it's the earth you know. Like what do you mean by that? Eventually you find out that ground means that that's a plane of neutral electricity so that you can have high voltage and low voltage and ground means, and there is a way to learn it but it just took me a really long time to learn it because I wasn't really technical. So that's a really simple thing I learned that you know like I had to catch up on, but they're a lot more complex things you know, like when you learned about multiplexes, you're learning about the way that the voltage regulator really works on the inside you know. Those can be really difficult so it's a wrap your head around, but eventually with enough opening the pages and putting your eyes on it over and over and over, it become simple.

Think about, thinking that it's for smart people, for math people, or for people that got 4.0's in school you know. It's not you know, you have a wide range just like any other job out there, so once you get past that then you have to realize the book that you're reading maybe is written by computer scientists themselves you know. So there could be a time when you have to close the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know, find some material online, find some easy to understand topics that can kind of prep you to go back to the more difficult book that you're reading in your hands. So yeah the material can be hard sometimes, the projects that we have can be you know really demanding, but with enough time you know, they say seven years you become an expert.

Coming in you know like ready to work on Monday through Thursday but you know the weekend is theirs and even after the hour is done you know, even after the working time is done, they're still there's lots of video games going on, there's lots of card playing that that goes on you know during the work day. There looking at each other and making jokes you know doing you know a lot of like childish things all the time.

So officers kind of make slightly less than their civilian counterparts. That is, an officer you can take any officer and put them in a civilian job and they'd probably be making about ten to twenty thousand dollars more in the civilian sector. However, there's a lot of job security that comes with being in the military. You're not going to get fired unless you like really messed up. Now that you're protecting our country and you're doing it in an efficient manner you know, you're doing it effectively. So there's a cost with that and the cost is our salary, so there is a saying that the military don't make that much, and it can be true in some cases. However if you do it with pride and you enjoy you work and you think about the excellent retirement benefits that they give you, you'll see that maybe by the end of your twenty years you know, you didn't make that much less, however you have a much more fulfilling career. For enlisted people, it could very very similar or even better than your civic counterparts, at least for nuclear technicians we made a lot less than our civilian counterparts.  In fact many people get out after six or eight years and then they start working and they could easily make double what they're making. That is they leave as a first class petty officer making about sixty five or seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make double that working as Homer Simpson you know down at the nuclear power plant. Other things like maybe a cook or Boatsmen's Mate or let's say a weapons handler, they can find very very similar jobs out there so then they have the choice. Do I stay in the military that I've already put in like maybe six or seven years, or I do I become a civilian, maybe have to start all over, but start at a higher rate and higher job position than I would have if I would just join from high school. So many people in that position they probably stay in military because the retirements, and the amount of time they put in as far as their pride you know.

We do that twice and after that time, after that four year period, then you're scheduled to go work on a short command, and that should be anywhere from two to three years. So it depends on whether we're at war or not, whether the up tempo is really high or not, whether the ship that you're on has been out to sea a lot, but that's generally, the two year, the two year ship shore schedule is generally what it is.",how often do you go to sea?,will I get deployed?,how much will I be away from my family?,does everyone get deployed?,do I have to leave home if I am in the military?,,,,,"Lifestyle, Military, Benefits",Navy,What things are there for me to do on a ship?,"When you're on your ship you have a lot of opportunities available to you. Now I won't lie, the bigger the ship you're on the more opportunities that are available. So you have a really small ship let's say a destroyer, that's not small but like the destroyer is I guess a ship that has maybe a couple thousand people on it. It's kind of like a high school you could say, the size of a high school. And there aren't that many things to do. I've never been on a destroyer but I just know from my experience with the aircraft carrier. It has to have less than what I had and at least for an aircraft carrier which has five thousand people usually. When we're on deployment we have, it goes up to eight thousand people when you add all the people that come in with airplanes, and the people that take care of the airplanes, and the extra officers and enlisted people. Eight thousand people is the size of a small city. So on an aircraft carrier we have our own post office, we have our own little recreation center. We have a couple of places for fitness, but in general it is a war craft vessel. Therefore there aren't that many, there are limited places that you can do, that you can have on the ship that cater to entertainment. So people find their own entertainment. So for me, my entertainment on the ship was I'd watch movies all the time. So everybody has their own little laptop or their DVD player, you can rent movies from the little recreation center that's there. They had bands in little hidden spots of the ship. So there would be drums and guitars and you know like even keyboards all hidden, but that did they make space and you know they play as loud as they want. Obviously the fitness centers are there, and you can see card playing all over the place. Whenever there is a rack, a living quarter, then there's this little table outside you know like three or four of them. With couches to watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there, so that's how we spent our deployments.","if I am at sea, what can I do to relax?",is there free time to do stuff on a ship?,what kinds of break activity is there at sea?,Is a ship boring?,,,,,,"Advice, Decisions, Military",Navy,Why should someone choose to be a part of the Navy?,"I chose to be a part of the navy yes because I wanted to further my career and have you know a good salary, all the benefits, but I also feel that you have to serve your country at sometime in your life. Now I know that sounds cliche, but that's the way that I feel. I came from a really military family. My uncle was in the military, my dad was in the military, my brother was in the military, and me too, and although yes I could of just been a civilian, like I was on that path. It felt like, at least for me in particular, it felt like something would've been missing from my life, something I can't be on my death bed and say that I never protected my country the way that I saw my family protect it. So it was a calling for me. Why would other people join the military especially if you don't have military people in your family, you have to think. Well first you have to trust your politicians. You'd have to think that they're going to war and they're defending America for good reason. So the wars that we fight we hope will bring stability to the world. You might see on TV that you know children are bloodied and people are you know like running for their lives, running from terrorism, running from lots of different things, you know you've seen the news. So if you wanna be a part of bringing that to an end, then military is one way that you can at least try. Also defending the nation, now we've been safe for a long time. Yes we had 9-11 and yes there are domestic terrorists but compared to other countries in the world, you might realize that America is a pretty safe place to live. When you're considering foreign powers trying to come in and influence us. So we have that strong military to thank for that.

That's fine for a lot of people, but for me I chose to try something different than the military job that I was doing because I wanted my job to be persistent. So this is what I mean. Right now I'm with the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technology making this video. This video could be seen by thousands, hundreds of thousands, hopefully millions of other Navy people. I could affect those lives. These are things that are going to be happening you know five years from now, ten years from now. So I can actually affect my world. Many engineering communities are like that. If you're making a robot right, if you make that robot on January 1st, hopefully December 31st you're shipping that robot, and that robot will go to Afghanistan and find a bomb you know. If you're an electrical technician, maybe you're making some kind of new component for a car and later on that car is gonna be faster because of the component you made. So for a lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a component, you create a product, and then you can see that product in action, and that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a STEM field.",how will I make a difference?,,,,,,,,,",does STEM change the world?,what mark can I leave doing this work?,,,,,,,",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Colleagues, Lifestyle",,How do you and your work colleagues socialize outside of work?,"There's a lot of socialization that happens outside of the military for military members.

But it could be lower, maybe twenty percent is probably what I'm guessing. The engineering field of the Navy is, on submarines depends you know which ones you're going on. If it's a fast attack submarine I think they just barely started just a couple years ago started allowing females on, and if you're on a ballistic submarine, which means they shoot nukes off, nuclear weapons off, then they don't have females on there at all.",how many guys and how many ladies at work?,is there a decent mix of men and women in the service?,are there many of both sexes where you have been assigned?,are any girls in the Navy?,,,,,,"Demographics, Military",Navy,What are the ethnic percentages of your workplace?,"The Navy is pretty diverse.

In California, which is very very diverse, then you have a lot more of a diverse mix there you know so, but despite that wherever there's a military town, it's much more diverse than the outlying area by far so you don't really have to worry about being in a select group in the military, it's it's all over the place. So I think from what I saw, there's, percentages would probably go maybe five percent Filipino, maybe ten percent black, maybe fifty percent white, twenty percent Asian, and then the rest is a kind of mix. But like I said it really depends on what your rate is. For maybe the higher level rates, it tends to be mostly white and Asian, and it also depends on which city you live in, for there's people that want to come back to live around their family.",are people at work from all races?,is there any segregation by race?,what is the breakdown of race and national origin in the workplace?,Is your work racially diverse?,,,,,,"Decisions, Military","Negative, Navy",Why do people leave this field or company?,"There are a lot of reasons that people leave the military. The military has a lot of great reasons to stay, the retirement benefits, the job security, serve the country. However, I think especially when people want to make a higher salary, and they find a good job outside and they want to just try to do something else, then that can be a good motivating factor. The military can be very dangerous, especially like for the people that send the planes off. If you do that you know every single year, month after month, day after day, then that could affect your hearing. You can be in many dangerous situations and some people just don't want to do that type of job anymore, that can be risky. Another reason that people leave the military is because they want to see their family grow. When you're on deployment that's a good six months that you don't see your daughter grow. You don't see your son grow, you're not with your wife, you're not with your husband. So after a few of those deployments, you kinda start to miss that, you actually want to see when your spouse has their kid you know. If your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born. And I know a lot of people who weren't there for that, so that's the third reason that I see a lot of people leave the military.",what makes people want to quit?,is there a reason that drives personnel to leave the service?,why do so many people leave the military?,what reasons are there to leave the Navy?,,,,,,"STEM, Decisions",Negative,Why do people leave the CS/STEM field?,"I've been in CS ever since 2008 and it's 2016, so about eight years and I wouldn't say I'm really perfect at it.

If you're just kinda average then you'll make an average salary so, but having a really good job is on the top of every computer scientist's mind, but not everybody is so great at it. So me I'm in Japan, I'm studying a lot I open books and watch online tutorials to try to get to that point. If I don't get to that point, then maybe I would try to do something similar to computer science, but maybe not specifically on, there's web designing, there's Electrician's Mate, there are lots of jobs that like, for instance a director. Those could be jobs.

We also have the Montgomery GI Bill, which was changed to the 9-11 educational benefit for people who have served and who get out of the military and want to continue on their, continue their education. You can use it while in the military but it's kind of a waste because they don't give you as much as people who get out actually get. There's also Ihis thing called CLEP (College-Level Examination Program) it's basically they allow you to take some courses that provide community college course credit, that's specifically for the military, and many of those CLEP courses are free. So you can actually like work towards your college degree with those CLEP courses for like while you're on deployment, which is when you're out fighting a war for six months, or when you're back home on shore during your off time.

So at the end of six or eight years, many people actually leave the service, so because that happens there's a wide open range for people that want to keep progressing, because like the top is open, so that means that you know they train and then once they get to that point, because nobody  is ahead of them, then they get the rate. There's also lots of Electrician's Mates available, like jobs available. So if you're in a job that has only a few spots available, like let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship, or a job that's really really nice, really comfortable and no one wants to leave, then that means that those higher positions are staying there, they don't retire after eight years or ten years, they stay until twenty. That means that that's gonna block.

I was also a nuclear technician and obviously there are much fewer jobs out there for that, but they can be found. So every job in the military has a basic breakdown of all the things that they performed in very general categories. So some are more transferable than others. If you worked on nuclear weapons then chances are there aren't that many jobs for you. Comparatively there aren't that many jobs out there. However, if you're a cook let's say, then you know every city, every town, every shop, every place that that has shops for cooks has a job that you can apply for.

It's a reserve, so we don't actively fight the wars. What we do is we, number one make sure that we are prepared to fight, and number two we train a lot to make sure that our mind is ready to fight. For me I was in the military for eight years, and then I got out joined the reserves. What that means is that the reserves call me at any time and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience being able to fight. That means I know what a ship is, I know how to read the label plates to find out what I'm looking for, I know how to fix these pumps, and I know how to drive the ship, I know the valves to close when you're trying to shut off steam. So these are things that they don't have to teach me, as opposed to a civilian who has no experience, no training, and maybe that doesn't have the discipline to come and fight the war right away. So if we're going to fight a war, first people that go over are the active duty people. If you need more people then they call on me, the reservist people, a reserve person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active duty member for the amount of time that the Navy tells me to be. It could be anywhere from a few months to several years. After that time, then I'm supposed to come back to my civilian job, hopefully the civilian job is still there for me when I get back.

So of course if you have one chief above you and you're an enlisted person and he's not listening to you, then what they say is that you can go above him. It's not generally expected that you do that, but it is possible you know. Everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down for the most part has an open door policy, which means that if something is on your mind you can come talk to them. Generally they like you to follow the hierarchy. So the first question that they are going to ask is ""did you ask the person underneath me?"" so beside you, if you have a problem with someone above you, you talk to the people to your left or right. Then you talk to the people, let's say it's a chief that you're complaining about, then you talk to another chief. And then, if neither of those listen, then maybe the senior chief or maybe the officer of the unit and onwards up.

So here's what I mean. The most important thing that you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in the book.",tell me about tough choices you have had to make.,what kinds of command decisions have fallen into your lap?,"do you have to make critical decisions and, if so, what kinds?",what major decisions have you faced in the military?,,,,,,"Advice, Background",,Who gave you the best advice about your life?,"The person who probably gave me the best advice about my life I have to say, it would be my friends, especially my Navy friends.

Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something. I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you can't be as rich as you normally would be.

That's, you know, the field that I'm choosing to go into. It's really hard to learn where to start with computer science. It's such a broad field and someone that's interested in STEM comes to me and says, ""What should I do? Where should I start?"" and I say, ""Okay, well, pick up a programming book, learn C#, learn C++ or learn any programming language actually and even that, that should be enough to, like, start them on their journey but it's not. There's so many different avenues to try and many of them are, I have to admit, are badly worded. For instance, when I was starting to learn computer science programming, some of the books that I picked up were made by computer scientists. I don't think that those are the ones that should be writing the computer science books. I think the people that should be writing are the educators, are the ones who think visually, are the ones who think graphically, are the ones who think, ""Well, you know, I'm showing C#, so I need to put some bombs and some explosions and some, you know, some nicely worded subtext. You know, like, I have to be able to write to a ten-year old and that the ten-year old should understand it. Rather than that, I think the ones who are really good at computer science, they're really smart, they're, you know, egg heads, you could say and then they decide to be educators and sometimes they don't match up.

There's mechanical, which you might think of as dealing with robots, dealing with things that go, have like bendy parts, metal things or, it doesn't even have to be metal. For instance, like, when you make a building, there's brick and mortar. Things like that, that's more mechanically based. Things that are big and you can touch, that's mechanical. So, mechanics means that it has some kind of operation associated with it. So, for instance, there's a table right and if you want to make a table that, like, moves up and down, then it has gears associated with it. So, that's the mechanical part of it. Or for instance, there's a plane. Of course there's computer science inside the plane, but the way that the wings move, the fact that, like when it shakes, it has to have some kind of calibration associated with it. So, there's a little bit electronics in there but basically all the physical outside part of the plane, that's, you know, mechanics. There's also aerodynamics, speaking of planes. So, you could probably get into, you know, airplanes and airplane mechanics by taking mechanics or aerodynamics. Spaceships, you know, aerodynamics. There is also, you can say, chemistry and physics. That's, they have a big STEM, you know, they're science but they also have a big engineering portion associated with it as well. So, there's chemical engineering. They're the ones that, actually, to tell you the truth, I don't know too much about what they do, but I know that they make a lot of money though. So, rather than create products, you know, you have this phosphorus and this sulphur and ""Boom!"", you know, it explodes in your face. They actually apply it to things, it's not like they're figuring out, like, new chemicals but they're using chemicals to make better products. So, that's chemistry. Then, there' physics. So, there's places that you can go to, like CERN or many universities, that they really. Physicists, you can think of as, people that go out and explore the world. All over the country, they look at rocks, they look at the crust of the earth, they look at the waters, they look at the gas in the air and beyond, people that work at NASA, they're physicists as well, you know, they're physicists there.

That's Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. So, he could be a cook. Chances are, there would be some kind of training that you do, based on, like, the grill. The fact that you're supposed to push these buttons and turn these knobs and, you know, you have to do maintenance on it, so you have to open it up and clean it or something that. That could happen. Additionally, when we do General Quarters, that's when, like the whole entire ship pretends that they're at war and, you know, they have to, like, do certain things to make sure that order is kept, that fires are put out, that, you know, like, if there's a hole in the wall that's patched up if it's flooding and you have to take it out. So, all of these things, they need some kind of understanding about the technology that's behind it. So, for instance, you have a fire fighting bottle and this is any job in the military, it could be a Boatswain's Mate, it could be a Quarter Master, it could be an Electrician's Mate, we all have to understand that this bottle has to put out this fire. The fire, you have to understand, is it class Charlie fire, class Alpha fire? You have to understand that the bottle is metal and it has to be on the ground and when you blow it, when you squeeze the trigger, that it has to be on the ground so you don't get shocked because of the speed at which the coolant leaves the nozzle. So, it's kind of technical in that way and you have to understand why. So, there are many things that are on the ship that can be considered STEM as well and you're going to be dealing with it no matter what you are. Some of us, like, we do it for our job no matter what. So, Electrician's Mate, you know, my normal job is check voltage and current, there's Fire Controlman, they're the ones who, like, use, they have to understand about the weapons and weapons systems. There's Electronics Technician who has to remove and replace the resistors that are in the circuit boards. There's mechanics who deal with the big pumps all around the ship, the gears, the switches, the panels, the turbine generators, you know.

They're probably not so easy to come by. I didn't know too many when I was growing up. There's probably a lot more now because it's a bigger field now but chances are, if you don't know a computer scientist, then obviously you go down the line, if you know an engineer. If you don't know an engineer, then even a mathematician. I don't know there's that many mathematicians I know either. So, anybody that can think logically about something, then they're probably a good person to go to and by that I mean, so if you're looking around a normal city, then anybody that is in the STEM field could probably give you some kind of idea about what they do and I don't think computer science would be that far behind. So, for instance, if you're a car mechanic. You can ask a car mechanic, ""Why do you like what you do?"". They're going to say, ""Well, I like cars. I have a few cars myself. And because I liked it so much, I wanted to know what was inside of the car. So, I remember the first time I pulled open the hood and then I was looking around on the inside and I was asking questions about all those things and at first it was very very daunting but after I learned what the, that thing there did and that engine part there did and that alternator does. Once I started learning about those, you know, then the pieces start to fit and eventually, I knew, you know, half the engine, 75% and then all of the engine and then it's really interesting at that point."" So, that little thing that I just told you, is probably what most STEM people would say about whatever it is that they're doing. As an Electrician, I would pry open up a load center and tell you the same exact thing. Well, those are the bars, those are the bus breakers, there's the current, voltage, blah, blah, blah. As a computer scientist, I'd tell you the same thing. This is, like, the program and this is, like, the initial settings, and you go down here and here are all these functions and this function does this and this function does that. As an Electricians, I'm sorry, an Electronics Technician, I'd tell you the same thing about a circuit breaker. Well, this is the resistor and this is the motherboard and, you know, this goes over here to that part and here's the blueprint for it and so, I would say the same thing that the car mechanic would say about that circuit breaker.

If you're a public servant, it's very hard to get fired. That's a pretty common meme that we always say. You'd have to do something really terrible to be fired. You can not be promoted as much or you can get like pretty bad jobs but once you're in the system then you don't really get kicked out because of all the fairness laws in place. If you're in the private sector, then you have to realize that their main goal is to make money. That's the point of a business, to make money. So, number one, if you're not producing, if you're in the public sector, you just get kind of shifted around and if you're in the private sector, you get fired. So, you have to have a better work ethic, I think. So, for instance, in the public sector, there could be many days that you kind of just sit around, kind of with your hands in your pocket, especially if there's not that much work. You have high work and low work and during low work, then you're just not expected to do that much whereas in the private sector, they will find something for you to do because they're paying you. Otherwise, they'll just lay you off or something. So, it's two different reasons that you exist. For the public, your main goal is to serve the people and they want you to keep your job. They want to have the same workforce in play most of the time, so it doesn't really matter how the, what the job outlook is like. You're probably keep your job if they like your work experience and you're just kind of, sit there whereas the private sector, if they're doing bad, then you're doing bad and, you know, you have to maintain a good reputation, you have to, kind of, be smart and if you want to be promoted, then you have to, like, really show your worth more in the private sector. However, at least in the private sector, you get to make a lot more money. You're not on the federal pension system, you're not on the federal salary system. So, depending on what type of job you want to do in the private sector, you can make lots of money.

If you get into computer science, all of your instructors are going to say, ""You can learn any language. It doesn't matter which one it is. They're all the same"", which is, you know, it's true in a sense. So, C# for me, has been the easiest language to learn. Yes, all computer science languages are very very similar but some are easier to learn than others and it's because I like that for purpose. I think everything, from cars to airplanes, everything that's been created has a curve where it should be easier, the later it is in its cycle. So, when computers first came around, everybody was working with vacuum tubes, you know, physical things. Then, it became assembly language, then it became machine language, then it became A, then B, then C, then C#, then Python and Java. So, the later languages I think are based on the ones before and they said, ""Hey, how can we make this easier?"" and it just got better and better and better. So, for me, C#, it sounds like someone's talking, it sounds like, by sound I mean, you look at the code and it says ""If Bob is"". Anyways, it's really easy to read once you're reading the code and earlier versions I think are not as user-friendly.

When you're on deployment, then your free time goes from maybe eight hours later in the day down to maybe two or three. You don't have that much free time. During those times, you really suck them, you really suck the juice out of them, so you're watching DVDs or you're drumming down in, like, the basement or you're just sitting back, relaxing, watching some TV or reading a comic or something like that and the two or three hours, you really make the most use of it. When you are, when I got out of the military and I started going to school full-time, then, I guess my days were a little bit easier. Going to school full-time, that's about thirty hours to sixty hours, depending on whether you're taking the easy class or hard class. But even for me, when I was taking easier classes, then I try to find part-time work, to add on the extra twenty or thirty hours to it.

For example, when I was at Berkeley, I was taking my artificial intelligence class and there are about four hundred people. There there was one other African American female, she always sat in the front and there was me. Besides that, it was basically whites and Asians. For the military, I'm an Electrician's Mate on the nuclear side and that's not very ethnically diverse either. That's because nuclear technology and basically engineering, is kind of a higher level field and unfortunately, blacks and Hispanics don't really shine in those areas as much as whites and Asians do. So, the military is very diverse but blacks and Hispanics are usually in the fields that don't require as much technical thinking but at least on the civilian side, at least in school, Berkeley had lots of different cultures but they're mainly in the humanities section not so much the engineering section. That's something that I'm trying to change myself. That's the reason that I'm in computer science at the first place because I want to do education so I can help people like me, you know, who were young and wanted to have some kind of inspiration to do technically oriented jobs but I didn't really know where to start, so. It has a long way to go. In fact, even at USC, out of the whole entire games department, I'm the only black person that's there.

So, I've lived in a white household, not the entire time, but for some portion of my life and I kind of saw the way that education was being presented to me and to the students that I saw around us. Education is number one, you're supposed to be doing your homework when you come home. You know, there's probably an hour, two hours that you have to, you know, focus on your education and then you can go play, things like that. Whereas in the black households that I lived in, it really wasn't an issue. For instance, my mother, she didn't even graduate high school. My father did, but he wasn't really interested in my education. So, there were things that I did when I was a kid. They give you five dollars if you, you know, like, do all your homework for that week or they look at your report card and, you know, ""As and Bs, okay, well, you know, you don't get in trouble"" or things like that. But it wasn't really, college wasn't really pushed. For instance, I never heard the name of any college from any of my family, my mom's side or my dad's side, because they were divorced right. So, that's opposed to the white households that I lived in and, you know, then you're always hearing about University of Michigan and, you know, we're going to go to a college game this weekend or this person is coming from University of Nebraska and you know, here is what he's doing. So, it's, those things are pushed on you, you know, every week, every other day, you know, it's part of the culture. You're expected to graduate from high school and then go on to college and that's very obvious whereas in the, I even lived in a Mexican household and it just wasn't there. The parents usually didn't go to college themselves and it's more like you have a range of different possibilities. You can go to college, if you're smart or you can work down the street, that's where your father worked. Or, you can just live your own life and make your own choices. Those are the options that are available and that are persistent in minority cultures.

I mean, they're the ones who are always submitting their homework, you know, always got the best grades, maybe guys, kind of, just, like, sit back and don't really, like, pay much attention. So, you think that girls would be in abundance in STEM but it turns out to be the opposite. After you get into college, it switches. Girls are mostly humanities and guys are mostly, you know, technically oriented and I think it has to do with just the mindset of girls, I guess. Maybe because so many guys are in the technical roles, then maybe girls get to college and think, ""Well, you know, those technical jobs are for guys.

So, for instance, an example is, I wanted to go to the Naval Academy when I first joined the military. They didn't accept me and I thought that was, it's the last time that I could apply. I was 22 when I joined or when I joined and tried to apply and the limit they can be is 23 and I was at that point. So, the next year I wasn't able to apply and it just, like, set me back.

So, in order to get back on track, you have to talk to your people, you have to talk to your mentors if you have any, you have to, you know, take something from yourself and say, ""You know what, even though I won't get there as fast as I was going to or as easily as I was going to, is it still a goal worth going on this new path?""

If you've ever heard of Steppenwolf, he's the one who created that, you know, the band called Steppenwolf was named after one of his books and I've read most of his works. It taught me, well, his works taught me that, number one, there are really some bright people out there who are masters at their craft and I kind of got faith in humanity because of him. Now, I'm a STEM person and he is as humanities as you can get but despite that, I like the way that he presented what was on his mind through paper, to me. That's kind of the way that I try to make my code. I try to think, ""Well someone's going to be looking at my code later. So I have to make it very very clear. Even though it's a complex thing that I'm writing, someone has to be able to, like, look at it without me talking to them physically and understand what it is that I'm trying to, that I'm trying to present.""

Now, the game that we were working on, it was the first virtual reality project from University of Southern California. It's basically the master's thesis of masters stuents. It was a virtual reality game that you put on the headset and you're supposed to memorize things in this virtual world. For instance, one of the things that we were memorizing is cards. So, here's an ace of spades, jack of clubs, nine of hearts and there are may be ten that you have to memorize and at the very end, there's this test and based on the fact that you're in an interactive world, you know, listening to music, seeing the cards on the screen, that's supposed to help you memorize things more than if you just, like, saw a plain deck of cards, you know, and there was research associated with it. So, I was the lead designer for that. Now, the design that I created wasn't so spectacular, Some of the coding that I did wasn't so spectacular. The reason that I'm most proud of it is because that's the first time that I ever really took on a product myself and I was very confident in what I was doing. This was a master's course, so of course I'm supposed to be an expert at my field. When I was an undergrad, I have to say, I wasn't the past student around. At Berkeley, there are some really bright kids there. There are people there that could have went to Google and Apple and Facebook from day one, you know, they were just there to get a sheet of paper but for me, I was actually learning computer science and I had to, kind of like, hold my own against all of these really bright kids. So, of course, I'm going to feel a little intimidated, always asking questions, always asking the teacher, you know, ""I don't understand this"", you know, getting these big long assignments, you know, ""I don't get it, don't get it, don't get it"", need to open the book and kind of, like, scratch one by one by one at a slow pace and, you know, you look to your left and right and people just getting it all the time. Throughout my Berkeley career, I became more and more confident but I wasn't really sure upon graduating if I was ready.

But it really opened my eyes into how computer scientists think. Halfway through the class, I realized that, you know, when I am sitting behind the computer, typing so much, which is what I thought computer science was, I thought it was like ones and zeros, bits and numbers. Most of the time, he was writing and drawing things up on the board, up on the white screen and even right now, you know, when I'm when coding, most of what I do, a lot of what I do is with sheets of paper and drawing and pictures and stuff. So, he really, like, kind of opened my eyes to what a computer scientist does. A computer scientist doesn't type code on the computer screen. That's his tool but what he does is, he thinks logically about his product and that consists of visual representations and those are things that are interesting to me and Professor Wilkinson was the first person that, kind of, showed it to me.",Have you had a mentor that has helped you academically?,Who is your mentor?,What mentor has influenced your academic decisions?,What experience do you have with mentors?,,,,,,"Mentor, Background, Impact",,Who is a person that you considered as a role model early in your life? How and why does this person impact your life?,"An early role model for me would have been, his name is Ronald Jester, he was a GM mechanic. I was, I guess freshman, sophomore in high school and he is somebody that found me at one of the buildings that I was that. I was speaking German with my brother and because I used to live in Germany, I could speak it, you know, like, a little bit and he was, you know, German origin. He went to German church and he's downstairs in the basement of this building, you know, kind of, tutoring other black kids and he was very interested and like, ""Hey, I hear the language of my family. What is this, you know, in this place?"" and he was like, ""Those two black kids over there are talking."" That really freaked him out. ""So, tell me about your story"" and we kind of told him about where we lived and about our mom and our dad and, you know, how we bounced around from place to place and spoke a little bit of German. So, he could understand that we're kind of bright. So, he said, ""Hey, you know, why don't you come over to my place? You know, come to our German church"" and, you know, like, and he introduced us around and that's how it started. So, his family was white, his mom and dad obviously really raised him to be, you know, a very respectable young man in the community. You know, he had his own house, he was 26. Three bedroom house and it was really nice and clean and you know, it's something that we really weren't used to, you know, back in my family. I guess I had my sister, she was ten years older than me, she was 26 as well, you know, she had a couple of kids and my mom, you know, she was divorced, so, like, it was all of us living in this one house and, you know it's like really cramped and it wasn't exactly dirty but it was very, in an impoverished area but he lived in Grand Blanc, Michigan which is a nicer part of, you know, Michigan and, you know, everyone has gone to college and the church, you know, everyone was like a community. It's very, two different aspects of life. So, that's the first person that I actually saw that really inspired me, really taught me the difference between what education is and what your life could be if you didn't have education. So, you could say that he was one of my first role models.",Who was your role model?,Who did you look up to?,Is there anyone you admired?,What is an example of one of your role models?,,,,,,"STEM, Culture",,Describe an experience that illuminates STEM culture,"For me, computer science is the main culture, you could say, that illuminates STEM.

But I think all of the, well, many of the other engineering fields have their own little style with them as well. So, the mechanic people might be, you know, working on robots and, you know, they're kind of like computer scientists too. For the, lets say, aerospace people, I'm not really familiar with them but I would think that they have their own, like, kind of pilot culture associated with them as well, maybe more towards the NASA thing. So, if you've ever seen like YouTube videos of, you know, people going out in the space and, you know, like, the astronauts you know, kind of just like floating there in the air. That to me really, they're for me, they are the true engineers. When I think people doing the hard math problems, the hard, you know, science problems, I'm thinking of astronauts, to tell you the truth.

The bar going sailor and I think that pretty much is a fact. That is true.

So, when I was in the military, as an Electrician's Mate, I had different watches that I would go to. So, I could be sitting in a chair, with a little handle twisting and left and right, so that there can be more steam, so that the ship can go faster or slower and you do that for six hours in this nice air-conditioned room. The mechanics outside of the little station that I was at, they're on the hot deck with steam rushing by them, so it's really really sweaty and kind of greasy and they do that for six hours and they just go around walking, looking at gauges, checking oil pressure, cleaning up whenever it needs to happen and running around left and right, you know, picking up phones. So, they have almost the opposite situation that I was in. I was in a nice conditioned area, you know, sitting in a chair for six hours, they're standing up, walking up and down the stairs, doing this job. That was the military life and obviously it can range, you know, there are cooks that are behind the stove all day, flipping burgers like they're in McDonald's, there is the watch station supervisor who's running on three decks in two different plants, sometimes going up four flights of stairs just to make sure that everybody's doing the job that they're supposed to be doing and there's the Boatswain's Mate, who is turning the ship left and right, who has really high-level people, maybe he's talking to the commanding officer, talking to the executive officer with, like, three people behind him and, you know, it's very very, like, has to be very strict and, you know, says things, you know, the right thing at the right time so that the ship doesn't crash into another ship. So, depends on your job obviously, your living conditions. As a computer scientist, my job has ranged from working as a residential <unknown> consultant, going from building to building, house to house, talking with different students about how their operating system works or how to make it work better or remove viruses or something. Also, at my job at the University of Southern California I was working as a QA inspector, a QA analyst, who would just kind of sit in the same seat, with his laptop, kind of, just not going anywhere, except to get a Snickers or something like that. My job has been varied throughout my career.",What environments have you worked in?,What are the usual surroundings for your work?,What is the environment like for your work?,How are the settings of your work environment?,,,,,,"Challenges, Background",,What struggles did you overcome to get where you are?,"The biggest struggle that I had to overcome, to finally be a Chief in the United States Military Reserve, to be a  Master's student at the University of Southern California, I had to really fend for myself for much of my life. I've had family that's taking care of me, I'm very thankful for that. All the way up until I was eighteen. After I turned eighteen, then I split from my father and I hadn't really seen too much of my family after that. So, I had to support myself, my own finances. Yeah, when I was eighteen, I had, like, forty dollars in my pocket and I think I was working part time at McDonald's and, you know, just a few bags of clothes at my feet and that's all I had in the world, you know. I guess everything I had was, you now, a couple of hundred dollars worth, maybe a hundred bucks worth, and that's it. So, I had to get from that to somehow getting a job with a good career that I could support myself and pay for my education eventually on my own and many people are like that. When you're eighteen, you know, you can get a job and you know, kind of support yourself but throughout this whole entire time, even when I wasn't in the military, I had to, you know, buy my own place, you know, support myself with my rent, with my food and without any skills, it was really difficult, I have to say. So, if you have a family that can support you during those times, that you can always go back to them if you lose your job, if you have to borrow the car, like little things like that, I didn't have. So, getting past that was a big step for me, it was a real challenge for me not having a family but eventually, I eventually joined the military and from that point on, everything was pretty much handed to you.

Obviously it's a great school and anybody would be really proud to go there but until that time, I felt, even though I was in the nuclear navy and you're allowed to have a really good job at the end, I knew that that job, being a nuclear-trained operator in the civilian world or even as a navy person, that wasn't for me, so it's kind of, like, I had to start fresh, and I did. After the military, I decided to be a computer scientist and I wasn't the best computer scientist around but I did have the good work ethic and it was obvious that I was trying really hard but I didn't really have a strong sense of my own confidence until Berkeley said that they were accepting me. That's when I knew, ""Hey, you know what? There are people that have been trying their whole entire lives to try to get into this school. There are people with 4.0s, with perfect SAT scores that are trying to get into this school"" and for them to accept me, that's kind of, validation for me. I know going to university isn't validation, any type of university isn't validation but it's something that I was trying really hard to do and I was successful at it. So, I consider that maybe one of my first major successes.

So, I applied there as a 22-year old and I got rejected. I joined the nuclear navy in order to have a better chance to go to that school and I was doing really well, I was one of the top students in my class and I was really fit and in shape and I did everything the right way but when it came time to apply, I put that I wanted to do a humanities type job when really the Naval Academy expects you to have a technical job. So I said, ""I think I want to major in economics or something because they can learn languages"" and I didn't think it really mattered what you applied for. The only thing that matters is that you're an officer and then they will send you wherever. So, I thought maybe economics would be, like, a job that I could, like, kind of enjoy, and you know, I like the type of math that they do and, you know, it's kind of business oriented but really, they want electronics technicians and math people and computer science people, you know, more than economics, so. The XO called me and he's like, ""Well, you know, if you would have done that, then maybe we would have considered that."" So, it feels like, ever since that day, I should, like, I wanted to go back in time and kind of change what I put on my recommendation so that I could've actually went to this really high level school and it didn't work out that way. So, instead I was a nuclear technician for eight years and I learned lots of things. I'm very happy for the job that I eventually did instead but if I had to do it again, then I guess I would have tried to make a better shot for the Naval Academy.",What failures make you the most upset?,What defeat makes you the most distressed?,Tell me about your most upsetting shortcoming.,Describe a time you failed.,For what failure do you have the most regret?,,,,,Risk,,What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?,"In the Navy, you're exposed to some type of danger all the time. They range in risks. So, most of the time, you're at pretty low risk but it can range high. I know a friend of mine who was a Chief like I am now but I was a first class when this happened. He was opening up a load breaker and, I'm sorry he was opening a circuit breaker and he was trying to check the high voltage of it and because they thought that the machine was completely powered off, they took less protection than they should have and many people were shocked when they actually put the machine in a place that it wasn't supposed to go to and he eventually wound up in the hospital, you know, burns all over his body and I was exposed to things like that all the time. In fact, as an electrician, you always are. Not all the time, not as much as some of the higher level people are. If you are kind of new, they don't expect you to work with high level equipment all the time. But if you're, you know, first class or chief or senior chief or so forth, then they expect you to, kind of, go in there and, kind of, do the test that you're supposed to. For me, personally I remember going into a breaker, that's where all of the, you know, the electricity and the current is, the high level voltage is and when I checked, it wasn't completely powered off. We didn't realize that at the time. So, if I would have touched the wrong thing at the wrong time, then it could have been an incident. However, we corrected the problem and there wasn't really any big danger to me.

Sometimes it's in the best interest of yourself and the people you work with to break the rules. This can be when you're giving some instructions and you yourself know the right thing to do. In those cases, you have to break the rules. So, this could be, an example could be, let's say you're supposed to do preventive maintenance on these three panels and because your time is, kind of, short, maybe the supervisor says, ""Only just do those two. Forget about the third one."" Or, ""You're supposed to do all three of them and you're supposed to read the notes but just do it as fast as possible"" you know, and he tells you that you're supposed to do it in a time that you can't possibly do it in. So, it's okay to break his rules in order to do the procedure correctly. You should never disregard the procedure though. If it's written down somewhere in words, don't ever break those rules. If you want to get trouble, if you want to get kicked out of the military, then be my guest, break those rules and, you know, you're going to be the first one out. But when it comes to the things that aren't black and white, when it comes to things that are, kind of, morally right or wrong, then you have to think about it yourself and think, ""Well, what was I thought, that's right?""  and so, for instance, an example would be, if you're out and you're at a bar and there's this drunk person and you're supposed to, let's say, bring him home, bring him back to the ship. But you know if you bring him back to the ship, that he's going to get in lots of trouble, maybe he will be kicked out of the military or something like that. Maybe, in that case you'll probably be wise to, for instance, not show him around the town, not show everyone that he's a drunk sailor, not bring him back to the ship so that, you know, he can be, you know, court martialed or something like that. Probably better, you know, think about it as a wise person to break the rule in that case. Find a nice hotel for him and then call your Chief as soon as possible to ask what the right thing to do is. Even though it's past your curfew time, you know, it's better to, you know, think smartly and wisely what's in the best interests of the United States military and do things that take common sense rather than, you know, this is the rule, you have to stand by.

I guess we kept people until, like, four thirty or five. I realized that people have to go and so, everyone was sent home. There was something slightly off about one of the sheets of paper that I was supposed to give him. For instance, maybe the name was supposed to written in signature but it was, like kind of, misspelled or something like that. So, something very very small and my commanding officer was really adamant about his people not leaving home so early. So, because I had let them go home early, he wanted them to come back. Now I called and I realized that the person that I let home early was an hour away. My commanding officer wanted him to come back. So, I said it's not in the best interest of that person to drive all the way back just for something small that I could correct. I could have whited it out and typed it on a typewriter and then given it back to him and that paper would have been just as good. So, even though I had a direct order from my commanding officer, ""Hey, I want you to come. Get him back into this office."" As a Chief, one of our main goals is to look out for people to, kind of, make sure that, you know, our morale is kept very high. Those are the type of people that want to work for you. Those are the type of people that say, ""You know what? Not only is he my supervisor, but he acts as a human being."" So, that's one of the times that I had to, like, stand, you know, at attention and, you know, make it clear, you know, talking to my commanding officer as a person, ""Yes, there's this rule and you have this choice but, you know what, here's another option that I'm presenting."" And even though I was yelled at, eventually that person didn't have to make the, you know, the two hour trip, just to make a small correction and the job still got done.

So, in the military, there aren't, you know, at least in the United States Navy, there isn't a good gender balance, I think, from what I understand, it's maybe three girls to seven guys, maybe even less than that on an aircraft carrier. So, there can be some cat calls, there can be some kind of playful, you know, communication in the work center which, you know, should not be allowed but obviously, it does. It doesn't get too out of hand but, well, when it does, we call people out on it. Some things could be when I see some of my shipmates post pictures on their wall. So, it can come from, like, Magazine or Maxim or even Playboy in some cases and it's posted up on the wall and then after a few days, you, kind of, like, see it like, ""Hey, what's that? You know, you have to take it off."" Or, you could be out in port, let's say you're in a foreign port and you're drinking with your friends and some person comes over, it could be a guy or girl and, you know, there could be some kind of grabbing or some kind of, like, improper touching. I've seen it, very often and you have to call it for what it is and some people get kicked out of the military. I knew that there is, when I was on the reserves, I heard about this guy. He had been in for, like, twenty years or maybe longer than that and he actually grabbed a female by her rear and she called out on that and he had to quit his career and he actually had to leave without getting into retirement.

One is my Navy Reserve career and the other one is my computer science career. In the Navy Reserve, I'm an Electrician's Mate Chief. I've been in for 17 years, 16 going on 17 years and I became a Chief, which is pretty high level, it an E7, out of E9 total. Those are the career steps, so, E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and I am an E7. It took ten years to get there and I've been a Chief for the last six years. So, to become a Chief, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication and being an expert at your job, that's, you know, the title of what we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be able to show our junior sailors how to do things because we've done it so much ourselves. So, to get to that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills, it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books, it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career, that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military, it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation. On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions, even English questions. I would present an English assignment and then I get it back and, you know, ""These are all the mistakes that you made."" So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook and I'd say, ""Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there should have been a semicolon there"", so, even simple things like that. And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military.",What do you do now?,How did you get to your current role?,Describe your steps in reaching your current position.,What was your process getting to your current position?,How did you get where you are today in your career?,What do you currently do and how did you get here?,,,,"Future, Background",,What is your plan to reach your career/life goal?,"The plan that I have to reach my life goal is to live, and what I mean by that is, I'm doing it right now.

When I started going to Berkeley, I just barely started computer science. So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer, he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained all of this to me and I'm like, ""Okay, we're going to be going to the same class, alright"" and to my right, there was somebody very very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah blah and I was like, ""Okay, so this is the average people going to my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some work for me to do."" So, that was what was on my plate when I first started going. For the military, I would say that something similar was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, ""I don't think so. I'm going to take it in to Midas."" I don't like grease, I didn't like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was like, so. But when I joined, I'm pretty sure everybody there had a big head start over me that I had to overcome.",Did you have fears going into college or your career?,What were you afraid of before you went to college?,Were you worried about anything when you were entering college or your career?,What concerns did you have prior to entering college and your career?,What were you fearful of before beginning college and your career?,,,,,"Background, JobSpecific, Skills, Growth/Learning",,What internships did you have? How did they prepare you?,"When I was in college, I actually did a couple of internships and they really helped me out a lot. The very first one that I did was when I was in community college. It was right before I was accepted to my university. It was at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. So, I was in the military before so that's probably a big reason why they accepted me for this internship but we were studying something, we were doing work on something called the MSAT. It's this big huge screen that Marines, kind of, like, sit in front of, with their guns, facing the screen and they're supposed to be talking to a helicopter and the helicopter is supposed to be dropping bombs on something. So, if they didn't have this screen, they'd actually have to do it in real life. They'd actually have to be on the desert and talk to a real helicopter to tell them to drop bombs on this place and the helicopter costs money, the people in the helicopter and the pilots cost money. Being out there in the field, you know, it all costs money but if you're doing virtually, then you save so much cash. So that's one of the first things that I was doing. The internship was to look at the code and help write the script so that when the person talks to the computer, that it understands what he says. So, if he says, ""Drop an illumination bomb on set XYZ in 300 yards. Explosion."" Maybe the computer might not exactly understand what he said. Maybe the computer hears, ''Alarmination instead of illumination"" and without that word, it wouldn't do the right thing. So, my goal was to say, ""Well, hey, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination but no matter what they say, as long as they say il-la, then the computer should understand the rest of what he's trying to say because there's only one type of bomb.""

When I was compared to the other people that I was working with, the other students at UC Berkeley and at USC, it seemed like they were pretty bright and I had to step up my game and to tell you the truth, even as a kid I was never really technically oriented. So, I think I had to work a little bit harder than other people to kind of get to a decent level. So, I took lots of late night study sessions, took lots of reading books, some Lynda.com courses, maybe some YouTube courses, Bucky's World, where he, kind of, explains these different programming assignments in easy to understand language rather than my professor because, like, I went to the lecturer and I didn't understand what he said so I better, like, learn on my own from this guy and then I can understand what professor said, you know, little bit better than usual.

For instance, I didn't really know what web design was, but when I started to learn what cascading style sheets were and how to put blocks on the screen and, you know, what a website was and how to read from a server, as I started to understand these things, like, ""Oh, you know, that seems kind of interesting. Maybe I'll be a web designer."" And then, you start to learn about, like, the operating system and I realize, like, what scheduling is, there's lots of stuff about operating systems and I decided, ""Oh hey, let's run away from that because it's not for me."" The more things I learned about computer science, the more focused I became in what it is I wanted to do. I always knew I liked to play games and after I started learning about what designers do, I finally focused in on that aspect of computer science, which is, I'm not the best programmer, there are programmers much better than me, I'm not the best artist, obviously, you know, those people with graphic design, you know, they do their own thing but what I did like to do is, kind of, go to a whiteboard, draw things out, kind of, explain what it is I wanted other people to do and myself included sometimes too and then have that be implemented. So, the more I did that, the more I said, ""You know what? Design is probably, it's been the funnest part of my job. It's the thing that has the least debugging, which, I hate debugging."" Debugging is when you have to, like, figure out the small little tiny portion wrong with your code, you know, and it could be, like, hidden in, you know, thousands and thousands of lines of code, you know, I hate those things. So, designers, they do the funnest part of the job without all of the negative benefits of finding small areas that could take such a long time.",Have your priorities changed throughout your development?,In what ways have your priorities adapted to your career situation?,What priorities do you have now that you didn't have earlier in your career?,Do you think differently now than you did at the start of your career?,Has your work shaped your priorities?,,,,,Motivation,Positive,What do you like to do the most?,"The things that I like to do most, well, right now that I'm in Japan, I love eating ramen, that's number one on my list.

So, eating is pretty high on the list. Because in Japan, they don't have all of the things that I'm used to in America, then I kind of, just kind of hang out by myself, go to bars, obviously talking with friends and I play video games a lot while I'm here. So, that's, kind of like, the way that I pass my time. Back in the states, I like to play basketball and I like to shoot archery, that's one of the things that I love to do and study, it's something that's I spend most my time with but actually enjoy. It's enjoyable because my major is making games. So, making games is something, it's, kind of, fun.

Of course, if there are fewer people, then that means the supply and demand thing goes like this and, you know, if there are fewer people, I'll make more money and my skill would be more desirable but that's not the way that I see it. I think that, and I've gotten flak for this before, but I say that everybody should be a programmer and my friend would say, ""How can everybody a programmer? You have to, you know, think a certain way and not everybody is, you know, mechanically, you know, programmatically and engineeringly inclined."" But I think that programming in particular, is something that not only should everybody do but it's something that everybody should learn. This is what I mean. I was looking at this five-year old and she has a tablet and with this tablet, she goes into the computer and she opens up a program, she plays whatever game she's playing and then she closes it. And to me, that is programming. You might say, ""Well, she didn't type anything."" Well, to me, she operated a computer system and it just so happens that the program that she did was very very easy, it can be done with her finger, it can be done by pressing the start menu and swiping to the left and click on this button and then she makes the thing blow up by pressing this button but this is operating, this is technically programming. It's just doing it in a very very high level abstract way. So, everybody should be able to program and everybody does. Everyone who has a smartphone is technically programming. Everybody who has a tablet is programming. Everyone who knows how to type, technically you're programming. So, I guess it depends on the degree to which you're willing to accept the definition. I think that programming should be in every job as well and to a degree it is. Most people, regardless of what job that you do, is going to be behind a computer at some point in their career. Whether you're an auto mechanic, whether you're a NASA engineer, whether you're an Electrician's Mate, you will be behind the computer doing something online and the more opportunity, the more time you spend behind that computer, the more opportunities that programming itself will help you. So, if you're an auto mechanic, yes, you can use a program that somebody created for you but if you know how to program yourself, then you can create your own program. You can customize it for whatever job you're on, even for your specific work site. So, it can only help you. So, just like I think that everybody should learn how to type and it came to be true, I think that everybody should learn how to program and hopefully it will be true one day as well.",Does this field have a lack of talent?,Does this field need more workers?,Is your profession short on hires?,How many people are going into your career?,Does this field need me?,,,,,"Future, JobSpecific",,What sorts of changes are occurring in your occupation?,"Some of the changes that I see are really happening at a really fast rate. According to Moore's law, he says that we double in our computer science ability every two years and it's very very apparent in a lot of places. One place I see, which is very specific to me, is virtual reality. They said that, just a couple years ago, virtual reality will be everywhere. Facebook bought Oculus recently and it should be on everybody's head pretty soon here but it hasn't turned out to be that way but it will. I think in a couple of years, everyone will be living in a virtual reality just like everyone has a PlayStation or Xbox back home. I also see that servers, servers is not the right word, maybe database administration is going to get a really big push forward and the reason for this is because, I think everybody is going to have their own virtual avatar in one way, shape or form in the next few years. Everybody kind of does, already with Facebook, they have their own website, their own profile and in that profile, you have a big cache of pictures, you have places where they've been, you have the friend connections. All of this is, like, one little set as a person but I think that's going to be very very expanded. Not only is there just going to be your picture and your name and your pictures, but it's also going to be, maybe, some of the applications that you like to use. Maybe your own personal virtual avatar who is dressed in a certain way. Maybe all of the shops that you like to buy at. And all of that, it's kind of, like Facebook times a hundred. This is where we're going to go. So, all of that needs to be managed and organized. So, that field is also going to explode, I think a lot. The final place, I think, is probably going to be artificial intelligence. So, we have self-driving cars, we have Tesla with its new and improve, like, hybrid cars. Maybe cars that you talk to, that you tell them where to go and then they find the most direct route to the location. You have SpaceX, where you send up rockets that require fewer and fewer people. That means that the computing needs to figure out things on its own. You have machine learning where you give the computer simple instructions and it needs to think for itself to learn, how to learn so it can, like, double or quadruple or, you know, times a hundred their original commands so that they can figure out these things on itself, by itself.

So, this is the difference between the people that survived the dot crash and the people that had to go. So, an example would be, let's say Kodak, Kodak is a maker of cameras. They had the Polaroid camera. However, eventually people started using digital cameras. People started using their phones for cameras and rather than take advantage of this technology, Kodak, kind of, just sat with their usual product and as we can see, where people started to switch over their photo taking format, Kodak started to decline. Another example would be Netflix. So, I'm sorry, Netflix is an online video producer, who took over the big reign that Blockbuster used to have. Blockbuster was a big building that you go inside, you choose whichever video you wanted to, you take it up to the front, you pay your money and and you take the video for three days, then you're supposed to bring it back. If you don't bring it back, then you have to pay these fees. And Netflix kind of saw that and then they made an online video retailer store. And Blockbuster didn't follow suit with that and that's why they, kind of, like, I think, went belly-up. Maybe they're still around but they didn't get with the times. So, my point for saying this, with Kodak, with Blockbuster, you have to look a couple years in the future, maybe even longer and wherever you see technology going, that's where you have to change. Now, there's a big impetus for people to have a working product and say, ""This is our goal, this is the thing that we do.""

One that stands out, that I'm immediately thinking about is, when I went to Japan for the first time. I went to Sasebo and it's not the, you know, the most exciting thing that I've ever done but it was the first time that I was in the country that I wanted to be in, during the time that I wanted to be at for an extended amount of time. So, I was in Sasebo, which is at the very very bottom of Japan, like little city that you've probably never heard of but it's close to a couple of major cities. So, I think I went to Hiroshima which is the city that was bombed in the war, in World War 2 and that was an experience, just walking around, seeing the peace park and things like that. I went to Fukuoka, which is a really big city, similar to Tokyo, it's not as big as Tokyo but it has many of the same styles of buildings and highrises and when I was walking past one of the computers, this is what, in 2006, I noticed that it had a funny shape to it. I'm walking past and I'm like, you know, Japan is supposed to be one of the world's best electrical countries right, the ones with the highest grade electrical equipment. So, I'm walking past this computer and my eyes are kind of, like, kind of weird. It was 3D, which is kind of weird because I wasn't wearing glasses, this is just while I was walking so I looked closer and as I turned around the computer, the person was, like, looking at me and moving her face and stuff and that's the first time I had ever seen it. Even right now, this is several years later, I still haven't seen something like that. So, that's when I, kind of, realized, ""Hey, you know what?

Now, I have to say that they all have very similar jobs. So, you can pretty much join any of them and find something that you like. However, that's about the limit of their comparison because for instance, if you join the Navy, let's say as a cook, you could be on an aircraft carrier going around Italy and Germany and Spain. If you join the Air Force as a cook, then you might be stationed on one base, Travis Air Force Base and that's where you work, that's where you stay, you don't really get to travel so much. You won't be stationed someplace else. Now, there are army bases, military bases, navy bases, airforce bases all over the world. So, your opportunity to travel to foreign places is wide open with any service that you join. However, many of them don't have that much forward progression as far as your career. For instance, from what I hear, the Air Force doesn't really promote as well as some of the, really traveling military services like the Marines, like the Navy and in fact, many people join the Air Force and stay in the Air Force for a long time and even though that's good for the Air Force, they don't have so much retention problem, it's bad for people that want to really progress because, for instance, if you want to become, like, an E7 rate, which is a Chief in the Navy, you have to wait for someone else to either move from the military or be promoted themselves. So, for instance, with the Air Force, it might take a long time for those people to leave because, you know, the Air Force is such a great career progression whereas in the Navy, you have lots of rotation. So, your chances of being promoted are really high. For the Navy, there are many opportunities to show your desire to really take on the hard jobs. So, you could be requested to go fight overseas and if you take that job on, then they really look high on, the people that promote you really look high on those opportunities whereas for other things like the Coast Guard and the Air Force, you might not have as many opportunities.

Also if you have a friend that can give you a decent paying job, you might wanna do that for a year or two while you save up some money so that when you do go to college you can really focus on it the way that you should instead of just trying to go by it slightly.

Everybody should try it if they can. For me, how college matter to me, it allowed me to really gain credentials for a job that otherwise I wouldn't. So I'm going to be going to an internship with NASA pretty soon and I see that the jobs that NASA requires, they need a college degree for it. So if you don't have a degree then you can't get into their program. However, other computer science jobs that I'm considering, they don't require anything at all. So you could be walking straight out of high school and you can have that job. The only thing they require is ""Can you program this? Yes or no?"" And if you can whether you have an MIT degree or the you just have a GED from your local high school. As long as you can do the job then you can do it. So it's really important to understand the types of jobs that you want. Realize that some of them need a sheet of paper that says that you can do the job, and some of them just are mostly based on experience in your own life. For me, I joined the Navy, I got this certificate from the military, which isn't a college class and then after I got out, then I could have this really high paying job without going to college myself. There are many people who say college isn't that important. However, what they're failing to realize is that when you go to college you're in a group of a lot of people similar to you, similar intelligence to you, going to the same classesas you, and being in that group really pushes you to try your best for four years. And at the end of that, then you get a sheet of paper, yes, and that allows you to, it opens more jobs for you, yes, but that entire experience is the college experience that many people have that you'll be glad that you had. It's the motivation from teachers, from your fellow peers, it's the late night study sessions, and all of that really makes you mature as a person. Not everybody needs it, but if you think that you have enough money and you have the time, and you want a job that requires that sheet of paper, the degree, then I'd say college is the right choice for you.",Why does the college you attend matter?,Does the college I go to matter?,Is the college I attend important to my later success?,Can I go to a low ranked college and still succeed?,Do I have to go to a renowned university to get a good education?,Why is it important to attend a good college?,In what ways does the college I attend matter?,,,"Training, Education, JobSpecific",,What did you learn for your career that you truly never used?,"For my navy career, I learned a lot of stuff doing six weeks of intensive electrical training, you learn about motors and shunts and shorts and opens and switches and valves and thousands of other things.

You know about it, you've heard about it, if it ever comes up in a problem or a technical class then you'll be familiar with it, but you don't really see it, and there's a good reason for that. It's because we do so much preventive maintenance on our equipment that the times that we have problems are few and far between. Yes we do have problems but they're not as complex as you might see in the books that you learn. That's our job though. Our job is to take on as much information as we can and have the access to the tools, we have access to like the books and the procedures that are required to fix the problem when we hear about it.

So before I joined the nuclear Navy, I took some community classes to kind of, prepare myself. I took conceptual physics because I had never taking physics before, and I took precalculus math because I know I would be learning calculus concepts later on. But whatever your level is, maybe you're not calculus ready yet, just take your bottom math and even though you weren't good at it before you know, it's kind of important. So bust out your high school skills, bust out your homework doing skills, and try to take on a mathematical class. Even if you have to repeat one, even though you did it in high school, try to do it over again if that's not your strong suit. Any science class could or could not, so you might not be using chemistry so much, so you can probably skip that unless you have some kind of chemical intensive job, but physics is a good one. I've seen many physics concepts in all of my engineering jobs that's computer science that's nuclear technology. Math, all the math that you can, as high as you can, up to differential equations. So that includes pre calculus math, calculus math, discrete math, differential equations, basically all the undergrad college level courses that you can take.

You might not be using the math, for instance calculus all the time, and you might not be using the complex calculus or the science that you see in your job. However there's a logic that's associated with it. There's a logic between doing the homework assignment seing the question, knowing the answer, having seen the way to solve the problem before, and you have this new question and you have to like solve it a certain way. So that is very very general. I just mention the math problem to you, but programming has the same thing, trying to figure out a new mechanical solution to a mechanical problem has the same line of thinking. So it's not just numbers, but it's the way that you solve problems, and if you got As, maybe even Bs in those classes, then you might be interested in STEM classes later, or STEM jobs later. If you are just so so in those classes, I would suggest that you try to take them over again, you do some personal learning on your own, and if you just isn't clicking with you then STEM might not be the best option for you.",Are there courses I can take to see if I can handle this field?,What courses will show me if I like this field?,Is there a course I can take to check if I will like STEM?,What class should I take to see if I like STEM?,,,,,,Education,,What courses were just a waste of time for you?,"Many of my math classes, I took them all right up through difference equations, and I'm glad that I took all of those classes, differential equations like wrapped everything up.

I went to University of California, Berkeley it's up near San Francisco, and I went to USC, that's also near the Los Angeles area. One big thing was the landscape. All three of those places were absolutely beautiful, Berkeley is kind of up on a hill, USC has beautiful pristine buildings, and my community college, it looked like a university. It was right beside Caltech, California Institute of Technology and you can tell that they're right beside each other because I couldn't tell the difference that it was a community college so. The people around is another big thing that's very important. So I like diversity. All three of my universities you walk around and you know all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Right now where I'm at in Japan it's not so much. So you can kind of really tell the difference and for me I just like seeing people similar to me, and different than me, and smarter than me, and people that I could trash in math you know. So I like that whole entire spectrum of people. Also I think the biggest thing for me when I decided my university was the reputation. So I tried to go to the best that I could. In fact I wasn't accepted to Berkeley the first time that I applied, and I said you know what I came from Washington all the way back to California my hometown specifically to go to this university, so once I was rejected, I went back to my university, I studied even harder, I got a 4.0 that semester, I took on another job, I did research, I did all the things, I took extra classes, I did all of the things to make me a really more mature, more intelligent person to finally get into that university, because I realize that worldwide, wherever I mentioned that university people would automatically know the process that I had to go through the schooling that I got, and it would give me you know the jobs that I needed, and maybe the math and the science and engineering and the programming that I required to do my future things.

When I graduated from high school and I tried to do college at the same time I was working, it was very very difficult so one of them had to give and unfortunately I couldn't stay in school that whole entire time. After that then I joined the military, I did my eight years, and then I had a good scholarship to help me pay for the rest of my education.

They also look at your intelligence, how well you know it, if you're an expert or not. So I did waste a lot of time, I did play lots of video games, I did watch lots of Netflix, and maybe college isn't the right place to do that.

In fact, even though some of the us are pushing it away, they provide you with training here and there, it's really required if you want to progress in your career. So they give you books that you can read, we have online video tutorials all the time. When you're at work people come up to you and they provide you training over and over and over. So it's pretty much handed to you on a plate. That's in contrast with my computer science career, where I don't have a main supervisor. And if I do have a main supervisor, he's not providing me with required material to learn. So basically it's hands on learning, it's manual learning, it's learning on your own at your own free pace. So both of those ways I found are really comfortable.

The education part was very writing intensive, talking and debating, and I like both of them. The reason I chose those majors is because I knew what my future job was going to be.

There are some officers who don't, but ninety-nine percent of them, they start off with a degree. You can become a lieutenant and even higher, there are many captains who don't have advanced degrees. However, to get very high, you are generally expected to get a master's at least. That's around the O5/O6-ish level because they like to see education. Going to enlisted people, you don't need any degree for the whole entire time that you're in. However, education is looked upon highly and if you do have a degree your chances for promotion to be honest, are a lot higher. Up to my rate, E7, it's really not looked on as being a requirement. However, from my rate and above, that's E7 and above, so that's E7, E8, and E9, they really spur on the education. So education in any way, if you've taken vocational classes, that's a check mark. If you have your degree while you're in the military, that's another big check mark too.

It's way off in the future that, you know, very very successful, financially wealthy and very very difficult and that's spurring me to keep trying. So I'm unsure about that and I'm unsure about whether I'll be good enough but hopefully, with everything that I'm doing, I'll wind up someplace that I need to be. I'll wind up someplace very successful.",Are you worried about your future?,What troubles you about the future?,What concerns you about the future?,Are you anxious about the future?,What makes you nervous about the coming years?,What factors of the future do you fret about?,,,,
