    transcript: "My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton
      Anderson. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most
      of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years
      after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States
      Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft
      carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you
      go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments
      and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of
      fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't
      quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the
      education benefits that we received and I started going to the University
      of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science
      and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University
      of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for
      Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks
      to the Navy."
