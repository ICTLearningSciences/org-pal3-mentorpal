    during the 10 years I've gotten my undergraduate degree, U C Berkeley gotten my
    master's at USC, and currently I'm a master student at the Naval Postgraduate

    We spent about about a month of time, working with them between your annual trainings
    and, um, amount of work that you do on the weekends for your Navy drill weekends.
    But overall, I've had a pretty productive 20 years, and I'm looking forward to
    my next. My next tour, currently the most, um, intense training that I've had
    in the most leadership role that I've had has been the senior enlisted adviser.
    Um, that's when I was working in Japan last year. Um, in 2019, I was overseeing
    about 50 sailors, um, stations throughout the country, and I was kind of explaining
    what to do, how to do their training, how to do their online, um, online stuff
    And, um, how toe go on their next and trainings things like that. I was basically
    a supervisor for them, and that's generally my role. My current role in the Navy
    right now.

  transcript: a statement that you hear over and over as you become a leader in the
    Navy is you have to know your people. I think that that's, ah, great quality to
    have. But you also have to pair it with listening. You have to listen to your
    people. So I I know that there are many leaders, um that have people come in.
    And then the leader just yelled at them and screams of them and says, You should
    do this and you should do that and then seems the way. So, um, there's a time
    for that. But for the most part, everyone has some kind of story. Nobody's out
    there trying to be evil. No one is out there trying to do the wrong thing for
    for the most part. So listen to their story, Um, and also be empathetic. So even
    if they were wrong, you should know, especially if they're young sailors. They
    didn't grow up the same way that you did. Um, yes, of course they can be treat
    out, but it's more important for them to understand why you're telling them to
    to do things a certain way and to get them on board What you don't want to do
    is instruct them. They know the right way, but then they leave, not wanting to
    do the right way. You have to make sure that your words come out so that hey,
    you know what? We're a team. You did it wrong. You understand that? You did it
    wrong. You're gonna be a leader for other people. So you have to do it this right
    way and you have to go. You have tow, have them leave saying you know what? Um,

  transcript: the most common mistake that I see new leaders make deals with them,
    providing information that they're not sure of themselves. As a chief, you always
    have toe think Well, you know what? I have the answers. I know the answers. And
    that's not 100% accurate. Yes, I am the person with the answers. But the more
    important question is where I get those answers from the reason that I have all
    the answers is because I have ah crew of people behind me that can back me up
    that have the answers throughout all of the people. And, um what first classes?
    The problem that I've seen in upcoming 1st and 2nd class is is thinking that they
    are the ones that that the information comes from themselves. And in that case
    you probably get some wrong answers. Um, depending on what they're saying. So,
    for instance, um, you're talking about an award. Oh, well, this award needs needs
    this and that. And you don't you don't need it. You don't need that block filled
    out. Well, some of those things could be wrong, but because they're under such
    stress toe actually provide an answer. They provide some answer the difference
    between new answers and, for instance, Chiefs. The chief will say, You're supposed
    to felt this block this block. It's supposed to be filled out like this. This
    block. Hold on, I'll get back to you And that's the difference between a strong
    and a week later.

    And once you know how they interact with each other, uh, you're bound to find
    some kind of dissension among these peoples. Um, they have lots of time together
    outside of work. Um, they might see each other at bars. Some of them might be
    dating other people that might have family problems. And those small problems
    can actually filter in into the unit now. Generally, there's not so much of a
    problem with that. That's how come you have, like people high fiving and people
    joking around and people like, uh, tapping each other. You want that kind of familial
    bond? But, um, if there is a problem, for instance, like, let's say, two people
    are dating and then they break up, then they're not gonna wanna work with each
    other or they're gonna work with each other bad. And for the most part, uh, it
    tends to go away. But if you don't take care of it, it can grow to be really,
    really, really big problem. Um, people's lives on the line. And if you have somebody

  transcript: there's this quote by Sun suu. I don't recall exactly the words, but
    the meaning of it really got to me. Uh, it went along. Lines of this, uh, the
    leaders that are most beloved are the ones that just, like, tell anybody everything,
    uh, next is most feared, uh, next to the ones who like, um, are really prized
    among everyone, but the ones who they're most effective are the invisible ones.
    It basically went like that. So I think that the mawr invisible you are as a leader.
    Um, even though you are controlling things from behind the scenes, uh, more credit
    that you give him, the better he'll respect you and you'll see it, um, devolved
    into the group. Ah, lot more if they take more responsibility of their actions.
    Um, even though they have a lot to learn and you are teaching them a lot, um,
    you don't want that to filter down to the crew. So, for instance, um, my first
    class would come into my office say, Hey, this needs to be on. I give him the
    exact instructions so that he can't fail. Then he goes out, and he described it
    to the crew. Now, little do the crew new do the little Does the crew know that
    I'm the one who actually explained things to him. But he was my, um my go to go
    through guy. And he's, um that's the way that you are supposed to handle leadership
    by passing it down through the ranks.

  transcript: there is a strong line that you need to draw between, um, your friends
    and your co workers and especially your co workers and your subordinates. Um,
    it can't be crossed over. They generally say that once you become a chief, all
    of the friends that you had, you know, if they were in your corner and if they
    were going to bat for you, then they'll understand the distinction that has to
    be drawn once you become a chief and they're not gonna treat you the same way
    that they did before. So you used to go toe clubbing or bars or joking around
    about the latest people on board this ship. All of that stops completely. So in
    that case, once you turn that switch off, how do you turn it back on? All the
    people have toe develop a new type of respect for you. Uh, it generally comes
    from the fact that you're very knowledgeable about your your subject. That's why
    you're promoted in the first place. And the second part has to do with the fact
    that you're caring for them. You know you're caring for them as a team member
    and that you're looking out for their safety. With those two pieces in mind, um,
    the balance will actually, um, come as a side point. Um, whenever they become
    the the same leadership position is useful. For instance, off. You know, third
    class petty officers become first class petty officers, first class, first class.
    Petty Officer has become chiefs and chiefs. Maybe they become officers. Once those
    huge balance or jumped, then you're able toe like I have the same communion, but,
    um, you definitely need to make that distinction.

    and then twist it off and drink it off and put the new one in. And, um, as a leader,
    you have to get that same job done without actually doing it. It's kind of weird,
    I know, but your role is to tell someone else to do it. And I've seen a lot of
    leaders have that problem, especially people that that have the new position.
    So a second class becomes the first class. I'd actually have to go down there
    and tell them. Hey, you know what? Get off that pipe. Get off. That's Lenny to
    sell. Um, you have three other people here. They're not gonna learn by you actually
    doing it. We know that you can do it. You've done it thousands of times. Now it's
    your time to put the wrench in that person's hand and watch him do it. Um and

    school? Okay, put that inside. How much of my saving up for my time after the
    Navy. Um, if I were to join the Navy Reserve, put that off to the side. What kind
    of certifications can I can I get? What kind of training can I get that goes on
    my record that I can have for later on later on, You kind of realize you don't
    realize it's actually like training on you. And, um generally, most chiefs feel
    this way. All the things and all the activities that I've done are kind of they're
    not meaningless, but their second fiddle thio the type of work or the type of
    things that I could give to my sailors. So for me, my e is whenever somebody gets
    promoted, um, second to that is whenever anyone gets an award and although that's
    not necessarily on my record, I do get, you know, some kind of credit for that.
    Um, I just feel like it's more important kind of like handing down the torch to
    someone else, and I think that's that's one of the best things that you can have
    as you grew up in leadership.

  transcript: if you're going to join any branch of service. One of the things you
    need to learn how to do if you're not on board yet is learn how to listen to people
    you're gonna be getting a lot of directions on your career is not gonna go very
    far If you can't follow them from the simple to the complex. You know it's gonna
    be coming at you all the time every single day, several times a day. The way that
    I prepared for myself, um, for coming into the nuclear power school actually started
    training. Um, I took a conceptual physics course and I took algebra, and that
    helped me through the school. Later on, um, after going through my initial school
    thing, I found out that, like, uh, even though there are schools available most
    of the time, you have to actually train yourself. So learning how to read is another
    big thing that you have to know. Um, if you haven't been a big reader before,
    especially in high school or middle school, um, that's gonna change if you're
    gonna be promoted. Um, of course, there are lots of opportunities and lots of
    training, but the ones I see succeed the most are the ones who actually can pick
    up a book on their off time and kind of teach themselves.

    tried Thio be the best leader that I could all the way up until I was the first
    class. And that was, you know, going on Google and looking here and, um, asking
    around and, you know, going to another office and saying, Hey, what's the policy
    on this, you know, kind of like, uh, wagon, my my telling a circle. But, um, before
    I joined the chief strings, and especially afterwards, I swapped up my leadership
    style. They actually taught me how to become a better leader. Um, a little bit
    during, um, my second class and my third class years, but a lot, especially during
    my first class years. And after I became in chief, uh, they told me which websites
    to visit. Uh, they told me, like which people in the separate departments toe
    go visit. So it's not necessarily a skill, um, of knowing how to do something
    but more about knowing who to talk to knowing that that was a resource that I
    had that I wasn't taking advantage of before

    was a really big surprise to me. Is the difference between the different ranks?
    Um, you have pity officers, then you have chiefs, and then you have officers and,
    um, they're split by whether you have a bachelor's degree and whether you've been
    commissioned. And I didn't really understand that critical piece until, like,
    well, in tow. After the time that I joined the join the service, um, for instance,
    people were being called Chiefs and Master Chiefs while I was in boot camp. They
    were saying, Well, you know, like if we don't do these certain things, there's
    certain things that, um, things first class is gonna make a chief and I didn't
    really understand, Like how you were supposed to be promoted along the lines of
    the military. Um, being a kid, I just thought, all right, your private I knew
    what that was, and I heard that there was an admiral and I knew what that was.
    And I thought you just joined. And then you just stay in. You get better and better
    and better at your job, and then you're finally you know an admiral or something.
    I had no idea about the rank structure. But now I know that separated by, um books
    and learning and degrees and evaluation marks and awards Eso I wish that would
    have been, uh, clarified even before I joined the service. Um eh, so that I could
    have a better idea of the structure of what I'm getting into.

  transcript: generally, the Chiefs know a lot more than some of his subordinates.
    There are times that I'm at a table and we talked for an hour just with the Chang,
    the chief engineer, the other officers in the units, the junior officers in the
    unit, about the overall goal of the ship. You know what? We have this ship in,
    uh, in Guam. We need to get it over to this other island. We have these problems
    with it. You know, this pump over here effects this pump be over there and without
    that pump than this other machine is gonna work, and you have to kind of understand
    all of it. Now, the sailors under you don't necessarily need to know that whole
    entire thing. It's gonna overwhelm them. Some of them have just been in for a
    few months. Others a year or two, and they're they're just getting the feel for
    the Navy. So they they're not gonna understand all of those other pieces of equipment
    or how they operate, But they don't need to. And that's the point. That's your
    whole goal as a chief, to separate the critical from the non critical. Um, so
    yeah, that our long conversation that I had talking about How we as a group as
    a ship as a department are going to get the ship from a to B. I filter that down
    to say, Hey, you know what? Third class, Petty officer, second class Petty officer,
    We have, uh, that's led to sell. That needs to be taken out and provided with
    this new one. Can you guys do that? Yes. Thing that that whole entire transformation
    of getting the ship from point A to B is just whittled down to that one small
    task for them.

    And I would like to say that that whole entire two year training that I had learning
    about electron ICS and he transferred fluid flow and nuclear technology in chemistry.
    Um, doesn't quite compare to the training that I got once I got to the USS John

    that are just as long or even longer. Um, when things could break because of you,
    when people get hurt, sometimes when you're falling asleep. But you're keeping

    that came from U. S s warrior and they were immediately put on the USS Blue Ridge
    and they slid right in. You know, after the second day, you couldn't tell them
    apart from anybody else, somebody that that just came in, he would not be able
    to say, Hey, you know what? Like this is a new guy. Um, that's the way the Navy
    is supposed to work when it doesn't. Then that's, uh, that's a time that, you
    know, you and the chief need to talk about what? What the problems are. Is it
    a personality problem? Is it the fact that you're dealing with this new equipment,
    that you don't know? Um, how to operate yet? But it shouldn't be that that case
    at all ast faras personality. We all try to be the same here. We try to be accepting
    opening a new person in the unit that makes our our unit better that makes our
    work go down. So you shouldn't have a problem. Uh, sliding into the unit assed
    faras work that you're getting, um we generally start you off at the level that
    you're supposed to be. If you're first class, you should know X, Y and Z should
    know how to manage your work center. You should know the equipment that you're
    working on. If you're second class, you should be familiar with, um, how to read

    when it when it's called for how to use your earplugs, you know, basic PPE. So
    we put you in the place that you're supposed to be. And if you're having conflicts,
    then, um, that's time to bring it up to the leadership.

    Thio for your first watch stations that could take up thio maybe four months or
    so After you get your first watch, you do that job sporadically, you know, maybe
    every day. But it could be like maybe five hours of watch standing, uh, in one
    role. That's log recorder. Um, that was the first job that I had. That's when
    you look at lots of gauges and you make sure that everything is within specifications.
    If something's out respect, then you tell the watch officer Hey, you know what?
    I'm down here at this up for long recorder. You're actually in an enclosed environment
    with the officer, So you kind of just look over and say, Hey, you know what? I'm
    reading this high temperature on this pump or high voltage on this turbine generator
    s so it's kind of simple at at the beginning. Uh, the other times you're actually
    giving physical hands toe work. So, for instance, let's say you have to clean
    out, um, a turbine generator or change out a pump or supposed to change out some
    light bulbs. Um, you do that for about a year, kind of easy work until you become
    maybe a second class, and that's when you start getting higher quality works.
    You, um, get higher positioned, um, watch stations. So propulsion Electrician's

    and voltages and current making sure everything's inspect, making sure there's
    no fires anywhere, making sure there's no smells going wrong. Um, after you do
    that, then you become a throttle hman. Um, that's another, um, later on, watch
    where you you have this little will in front of you. And there is a throttle man
    for every single, um, shaft. So you could be like shaft number one, and then you
    get ah, command from the navigation that says, Hey, you know what? We need to
    go all ahead two thirds full flank and you just open it up or set it down, uh,

    provide them with, um, general electrical things. Now you have to understand that

  transcript: when I was growing up, I I would say that it should have been involved
    with lots of bullying, but I had a different take on my actions. I had these glasses
    and, you know, thick glasses before, Um, you know, when they didn't, when they
    couldn't fit it out. I had these, like, um, glass holders, you know, that my grandmother
    gave me and, um, I also spoke proper and being in all black community, I was kind
    of looked at as, ah, prior it. Uh, I should have been the target of pulling a
    lot. However, when I experienced that, I would kind of just keep to myself, you
    know, I said, Well, you know what? Like thes thes people, Of course, there are
    lots of kids and you always, like, go out there, play tag with them. You play
    football with them. But I just kind of saw that they weren't, um my crew basically
    and kind of just stuck with myself. Um, that was when I was a young kid. Maybe
    before, you know, 89 I then went to Germany, and I started living on a on a military
    base. And after that, things completely changed. I think I had one or two more
    bullies after that. But for the most part, because we were all there, we all had
    a decent salary. We all had toys and games and intend does and bikes. And, you
    know, life was really good. And I think that that's one of the reasons that bullies
    exist because they're having some kind of problem with their lives on day kind
    of wanna, you know, spread the hate around. But when you're having, when you have
    a decent life when your when your father is in the military or your father is
    in the Army, your mother is like an admiral or something, and you have a standard
    paycheck. And, um, you can actually make your parents look bad if you do bad.
    If someone bullies mean, you know, their parents can actually hear it. So bullying
    basically stopped once I started going to Germany. Um, I was like that for two
    years, you know, great life. And then after another year, and then I went to the
    German section of Germany, and, um, even though I had the glasses, you know, like
    I was actually looking cooler at the time was actually also working out. Um, then
    I became a superstar. So for that year and a half, from seventh grade to eighth
    grade, Um, I was the most popular kid. Girls were liking me, and guys always wanted
    my friends, you know, invited me to their house. Um, life was really great. So
    my whole point is to say this once after spending those three years of building
    my confidence in Germany once I got back to the States. Um, yeah, of course. There
    were bullies there, but it just flew right off of me. You know, I said, you know
    what? Like I'm I'm a superstar, you know? You can't touch me. I'm really smart.
    Um, enough girls told me that I'm really handsome, you know, like So who are you?
    You know, like, there's nothing that you could possibly say that could actually
    like, Get me down, you know, and I e think I kept that, um, in high school junior
    year and senior. I was actually working out a lot. I think I had the body of a
    football player and I also got contacts. I mean, then I was I was actually really
    popular kid in high school. So, um yeah, I brushed, pulling off a soon as I went
    to Germany because I found a place Thio get my confidence from

    it's not the, um, brightest spot to be. I think the people, they're fine. I had
    family there, more family than I had ever had. Cousins and aunts. I had my mom
    and my sister and lots of kids. So there is a strong family connection there.
    Um, that I couldn't deny ast faras being poor. Um, I don't think that inherently,
    I'm I have the poor psyche, you know, I always do that. I would be successful
    in life regardless of what was in front of me. That's what everyone always said.
    You know, like, hey, you know what you're not gonna be, um maybe growing up in
    this area, you know, like you're not gonna This area is not for you. You, in fact,
    somebody I remember somebody actually said you're probably gonna be a rocket operator.
    And when I was working at NASA, I thought, you know, like some guy knew that when
    I was six years old, you know, it's it's not a coincidence. So, uh, even though
    I was in the midst of poverty and I can imagine a few a few cases where it could
    be worse. I mean, I had rats and mice at, uh, cockroaches everywhere. I had prostitutes.
    Um, yeah, yeah. Drugs was affected me a lot, you know, very close members died,
    you know, they lost their feet. They were in wheelchairs. Um, in every single
    case, I decided that that wasn't that wasn't going to be my life. And that wasn't
    the way I was going to present myself to the world. I think if you if I was to
    go anywhere, no one would be able to recognize me from growing up in a in an upper
    scale. You know, California home, because, like, that's not the way I talked that
    I wasn't involved with hoodlums. Uh, even though I was around drugs, I never tried
    it myself, and I avoided people who did it. So all of that combined just it was
    easy to ignore. Uh, that that's a bad word to say. Of course it was apparent,
    and there's no way that you could ignore it, But it's easy to put in your back

    with people you have thio get outside off the work environment and I mean, I mean
    it like this. You have to know about the people outside of the job that they're
    doing. It could be learning about their family. It could be knowing about their
    kids. It doesn't have to be super friendly. It doesn't say, Hey, you know what?

    if there are morale, recreation and warfare things that you can do together, um,
    that would be helpful. Um, one thing that I used to like to do is like, exercise
    together, saying, Hey, you know what? This Friday afternoon, uh, let's put on
    a PT gear and just, like, run together. Um, if it's an easy Friday, then let's
    go out and play some volleyball together. Um, you don't really have that much
    opportunity to do that. Let's say Let's it, let's say if you're underway, then,
    um, there aren't any weekends on the beach. So what do you do then? Well, you
    have to make sure that the team has enough enough material outside of the work
    so that they can actually communicate with each other. Um, in a friendly way.
    That means make sure that they have enough movies. If they if they were complaining
    about their lunch, making sure that they're well fed, you know, go talk to the
    galleys, remember and say, Hey, you know what? We have this birthday coming up.
    Can you bring a birthday cake in Thio to celebrate somebody's, um, somebody's
    birthday. You could actually have this award, you know, before you weren't really
    considered an award, but saying, Hey, you know what? Like it would really lift
    the spirits off the unit, help somebody with promotion. Let me think of how I
    can, uh, come up with an award, you know, make some kind of jobs so that they
    can get that award when you wouldn't have thought so. Otherwise. Like, there are
    many avenues that you have toe, Um, just not shove work down people's throats
    and say, Hey, you know what? Like we're in a team. I know this place is really
    long. You're sweating a lot, but let's figure out something else that you can
    do toe actually smile once once in a while.

  transcript: the right presence to have is for everyone to know. They're all, um
    do people have to understand that? You know what? Like I can't boss anyone around
    first class, petty officers have to understand. Hey, you know what? I was the
    second class, you know, a couple of months ago. I don't have the right to boss
    them around, despite my my new title. Chiefs have to understand. Hey, you know
    what? Even though I can boss people around, I don't want to, because they have
    to work for me. And officers have to realize that Yes, I have a commission. And
    yes, I am your commissioned officer, but, um, ultimately, you guys are the ones
    doing the work, and I have to respect that. So if everyone knows their role and
    they don't abuse their rules, uh, that's the best way to get along. So how can
    you do that? Well, you have to make sure that each of those lines is very, very
    clear. Um, this is our officer. He's in charge of X y Z. Um, if he spends most
    of his time up in the office, you know, that's fine, but it should be clear to
    the unit that he is serving a really good role. You know, you can't just say,
    Oh, we have an officer and you never talk about him. You never talk about his
    rules, his responsibilities. You know that's not good for the team because they
    don't develop a reporter with him. So I have to say, as an officer, he has a different
    rule than you guys. He's not down here working on equipment. He's not down here.
    Um, you know, cranking valves. I I want to say that because when I was coming
    up through the ranks, I didn't understand this difference. And I had a little
    resentment towards some of the officers that I saw was like, Hey, you know, we're
    down here sweating. We're busting our chops. How come I never see him? Um, now,
    as a chief, I make sure to explain that role toe the team toe to make sure that
    everyone understands everyone is working really hard. Um, and also explain the
    newest person you know, to the officer. Hey, you know what? Like even though he's
    just knew, you know, you have to realize, even though you don't see it, but he's
    down there in the build, getting his brand new uniformed dirty, you know, scrubbing
    and chipping and painting. You know, just to make sure that, you know, um, he's
    a valuable member of the team. So as long as everyone knows the value of each
    member of the team and it's very, very clear and there's no, uh, there's no crossing
    over, then that's how you build report with the team.

    Um, you generally, once work is over, you just go home to your to your family.
    Um, you just see each other for those couple of days out of the month. Um, sometimes
    when I'm on A T and your training for the Navy Reserve Um, let's see, I packed

    up together on a Saturday. We visit Boston if we're in, uh, in New Hampshire,
    Um, yeah. We generally find things to do outside of work on t help us grow together.

    been many times that I've taken people to the side after like, let's say, a heated
    argument, you know, kind of let him know that I'm a person, that he's a person
    in my eyes, Um, and even though you want to be their friend, you're not really
    allowed to, um, not until they're your level. So, for instance, if there a chief,
    then maybe you're allowed to do that. But because there's that there's that line
    that if other people saw you and realize that you were friends, then they would
    have They wouldn't have the same opinion. I think that they can promote at the
    same rate as that other person. That's why you choose not to be friends with another
    person with a subordinate. Now that's not saying that you can't be friendly. Friendly
    is still trying to understand about their their life, their personality, their
    spouse, their kids, um, wanting to know that information. You know, it helps you
    smile. It helps the day go by it well, but you can't go over their house and play
    cards with them. You can't, uh, sit down with them at a bar and just drink. You
    know, the night away. All that has to go out the window once you, um, get promoted
    through the ranks.

  transcript: the best way that you could help prepare for our mission, especially
    a strenuous mission, is to give them knowledge about what's to come. I recently
    just got off this in serve tour on the USS Blue Ridge. And as far as the team
    was concerned, there's thousands and thousands of jobs to be completed. Their
    tons and tons of work hours to be had, Um when I when I got there, I think they
    were waking up in the morning and then they wouldn't get to bed until, like, 10
    or 11 o'clock at night when I would get when I would, uh, finally tell him to
    break off for the night. And I think one of the issues was they didn't know how
    long it would last. Is this gonna be how all of deployment is gonna be? Is it?
    Are we gonna ever let up this weekend next month? When does it stop? If you had
    a plan about what things they're supposed to be completed and the amount of time
    they're supposed to take and you divided up in the equal portions and they could
    actually see what they're working on. Then they come in with a sense of saying,
    Hey, you know what? I'm gonna do this thing. And the longer I work, the closer
    I get to that goal. And with that in mind, then I think that will give them a
    better understanding about what they're supposed to do with their job. Without
    that information. Um, you kind of get depressed. You kind of get like down about
    how much work there is to be had.

    So if you're facing, uh, a really stand up guy who really knows his things, you
    can talk straight to him. You don't have to, like, filter your words. It all you
    can say, Hey, you know what? Like we need you to do this, you're not doing it

    want to say. You know what? Hey, you know what we need you up there. Um, toe paint.
    Now, if you just said, Hey, you're gonna do this, go up there and paint, you know,
    with one person, that would be just fine. Okay, Sure. No problem, Chief, With

    days ago, and I was up there last month. And how come you didn't choose? You know,
    joy over there, you know, he's not doing anything, so rather than, you know, say

    bit more explanation about why it is what Joey is doing. Um, there's a time for

    You know, when your third class or second class. Um, But if you wanted to say
    the same story as a chief, then people might lose respect for you even though
    it happened. And even though it is something to explain, because it does happen
    a lot, you know, um, you don't wanna mention those types of stories to your subordinates
    because number one they think that your actions air right. Since then, you've

  transcript: So for supervisors who are unable or unwilling to get feedback, Well,
    let's do different camps. If a supervisor is unable to give feedback on your leadership,
    then that just means that you just get someone else. Um, they can't. For some
    reason, maybe they're too busy. Maybe they're not there at the time. Um, maybe
    that's not their specialty. For whatever reason, Uh, it's very important for you
    to always get feedback on the quality work that you're doing, so it just doesn't
    have to be from him. Um, there's someone above him that you can go to. There are
    other people that he worked that he works with, that you can go to them. And there's
    also your fellow compatriots. Like if someone has done that job before, even though
    they're not a supervisor, um, they could still give you quality feedback that
    you can use in your own career if they're unwilling to, uh, that could be a different
    type of problem. Um, for the Navy, I'm pretty sure that most supervisors that

  transcript: The thing that I found that encourages accountability is ownership.
    If there's some task that you assigned with, if you're doing someone else's task,
    then basically, uh, the credit will belong to that person if it gets completed.
    However, if they say, um, Chief Anderson, this is your job and, um, its success
    or failure depends on you, then that actually puts ownership in my corner. And
    that makes me more accountable, because I know that if it's unsuccessful, it's
    not gonna go to him. That's something that you always have to think about as a
    leader. Take on every task as if it's your own, and that way you always be accountable
    for it on Did you get the credit as well as the failures for it?

    to number one kind of get to know them. Um, what's an interesting situation is
    when you go into a table and you're not familiar with any of the faces that around,
    um, people say things that because you don't know them personally, it's just a
    statement, Um, that they say, And you, you don't put it in the context of the
    type of person that that is, uh, for instance, somebody should somebody could
    say, Hey, you know what we need to have, you know, all of electrical division.
    Go down, um, and sit around the determine generator and make sure until it's fixed.
    If you didn't know that, that person meant that, Hey, you know, it's like, uh,
    it's a department wide thing and he's not saying every single person cool down
    there. You could think that he's a jerk. Um, otherwise, you could Let's say he's
    a really strong character, strong leader, and he really does mean hey really doesn't
    want people to go down there, every single one of them, right? If you didn't know
    that he has a long history of being successful that is really respected in his
    unit by his department, then you also you might think he's a jerk. But if you
    know where people stand and why they're saying the things that they that they

    a long there's there a lot of reasons for this number one because you're directly
    in charge off the military persons progression. Um, maybe you're not directly
    in charge, but you can control it. All you have to do is just tell is Chief. That's
    kind of like telling the mom or the dad of some kid versus a civilian, and that's
    more like dealing with a stranger. Number one. You have no idea who is boss is.
    If you do, maybe they're kind of separated. Uh, even if you did know him like
    because they're under government obligations, um, they can't really chastised
    the person under them the same way that a person in the military could. So it
    z not night and day, but because you're more involved in the leadership structure
    of the military person and you can affect them. Ah, lot more. They tend to listen
    more, and they tend to be more. We're willing to fight for one team rather than,

  transcript: I think the Navy is pretty unique because, unlike other other branches,
    for instance, I'm thinking of the Army, the Marines and Air Force. I'm not very
    familiar with them, but from what I've kind of seen is, I'm thinking of Let's
    say, March Air Force Base. I see lots of buildings all around, and I'm assuming
    that there's a floor for a department and there's, Ah, third floor for another
    department, and I bet that they don't interact as much. And I bet that that building
    that squadron doesn't interact as much with the squadron to squadron to the right.
    Compare that with the Navy when you take all of those buildings and all of those
    floors and stack them on top of each other. And now you have an aircraft carrier
    which has electrical division, mechanical division, the cooks, the boatswain's
    mates, and you always hear what everyone's doing all the time. This is the one
    EMC we'd like to think electrical division for fixing the mass. This is, uh, we'd
    like to thank the cooks for providing a good meal to everyone. We'd like to thank
    the boatswain's mates for guiding us through this treacherous territory. Um, we're
    all in this. We're all doing general quarters together. That means everyone has,
    um, firefighting pack on. And we're all seeing each other, talking to each other,
    seeing each other in the hallways, playing cards with each other during during
    galley mills. Um, you have a lot more interaction with the whole entire structure
    rather than being so split up. So I think that that navy it builds it builds community
    within your work center within your department within the entire ship. And I don't
    think that other military branches have that as much.

    used to play, and after my keys, my hands went on the keys and I started listening
    to music. I knew I was gonna at least give it being a musician, a shot. And then
    I used to live with my mother and she used to draw all the time. And so, after
    drawing my first few cricketers, I said, You know what? I'm an artist. And I think
    that really stuck with me the whole entire time that I was a kid when I was in
    middle school, I used to live in Germany and, uh, I was going to a German school
    and I didn't speak German at all. And then, um, we had to learn French while I
    was in Germany. So I was learning French in German, and I was translating the

    from my father's side, and my mom and my dad and I would split those four places
    all over the place. Um, sometimes in Alabama, which was, um, all black, which
    it was in an all black community. Um, e didn't really get along with the kids.
    You can tell that my speech is very, very proper. And there they have ah, very
    Southern, um, southern heritage. And it kind of clashed. I didn't make fun of
    a lot. Um, maybe where you from? You know, you don't speak like us. So, um, the
    regular building that everybody gets, um, moving up to Michigan. I stayed with
    my my mother, and, uh, that was mawr. That was more of an urban feel to it, but
    they we didn't grow up very rich at that time. You know, there were mice in their
    home. There was, um, drugs. I remember, you know, prostitutes in the house. So
    I didn't really try to stay home so much, but I really had a good relationship
    with my mom and my sister, who cared for me a lot. Um, later on around high school,
    high school time I lived, started living with my father, and it was just him.
    He didn't really, uh, care too much for me at the time. He had two jobs, and I
    could tell he was overworked. Um, so basically, I stayed at my school and I stayed
    around. My friends, uh, that led to us not having a really good relationship.
    So I moved out of the house when I was 18. So my my childhood was pretty interesting,
    to say the least.

  transcript: for me, one of the main benefits that I found from being the Navy comes
    from. I mean, I walk down the street and I get so much respect for being a veteran
    for serving the country and considering what I've done and what I've seen other
    people in my in my rate and in my, um, service do I think that is justified as
    a civilian? I so most right. I've been a student this whole entire time, and I
    have done some jobs. I've worked for the for NASA. I've worked for Institute for
    Creative Technologies at USC. I've done I've seen what software engineers do,
    and, um, they get a lot of pay for, um, strenuous work, no doubt. But there's
    no comparison for getting maybe paid half what? Your half. What your civilian
    counterparts get but doing ah lot more work for and most people in Navy don't
    Don't consider this. You could get paid more as you go askew. Go further in your
    career. But, um, most people in the Navy don't do this fourth salary. We do it
    for the type of work that we're doing, which is hard, strenuous. You know, young
    person you know, bottle physic, physical work. Um, that's serving the country.
    So I think that that's one of the main benefits that I got the fact the private
    get from being able to be one of the few people who can do that.

    expected to travel too much except for when you're on deployment. Now that I'm
    in the Navy reserves, they expect me to actually go outside of my, um, my command
    every single year. So we have these things called annual trainings and being in
    the surge main unit, we actually go toe five different places. We could go toe
    Hawaii or Norfolk or New Hampshire, Japan, Um, and, uh, other small places as
    well. So for the most part, they really want you to go toe one place so you can
    know the people and get to know your job Well, but as the chief, I decided to
    go toe all of those places because, hey, why not? You know, it's not gonna hurt
    anything. And I don't actually want to know where my people are and what they're
    doing, eh? So that gives me an opportunity to say I know what all these shipyards
    are like. I know exactly where you're going, and I know those people. So, um,

  transcript: When I first joined the Navy, they were trying to promote the Nuclear
    Propulsion School and they threw a lot of things on my desk. We'll we'll give
    you lots of money for school, which they did, and I've I've sucked it all up after
    you get out of Navy, then you can have $100,000 your job. And being a kid that
    was currently working at McDonald's, that sounded great. You know, like, uh, now
    I can have that $100,000 your job. No problem. Um, they said, Oh, you know, you
    become a veteran and you go to the Post Graduate School and they provide a lot
    of different things. But to tell you the truth, all of those kind of sift into
    the back to the background. Um, I'm still the name of this at this time, and I
    didn't become a nuclear, um, operator. At the end, however, I did get the challenge
    that they were talking about. That's the thing that really drove me tojoin the
    nuclear propulsion school. And that's the thing that I think I got the most out
    of. I was challenged more than I ever had been in my life, and that's something
    that you can't put a price on And that that's a job that I don't think that most
    of the other jobs that I saw the Navy wouldn't provide as much as, um, after getting
    out of the active duty service, I was a chief. And, of course, I love, you know,
    providing opportunities for people and helping them promote their career, You
    know, like all chiefs will say that. But what I personally like for myself about
    being, um, still in the Navy reserves is to travel. I did a lot of port calls
    when I was in active duty. And I'm telling you, I went to 13 different countries.
    Uh, Dubai, Bahrain. Kuwait, um, Japan, You know, dozens of places, but being in
    the reserve, you actually go to these places. They give you a car, they give you
    a hotel. Uh, they give you a decent work, they give you money in your pocket and
    on the weekends you can explore. So I've seen New York and the capital and, um,
    New Hampshire, places that I didn't think that I would go for a long time. I've
    seen Washington and you know, swimming the beaches of Hawaii, and they say that
    I'm working. That's that's incredible because I think that it's kind of like a
    or work vacation.

  transcript: being in the military is kind of like what it depicts on the TV for
    a lot in a lot of aspects. So, for instance, um, there's the Brotherhood. Uh,
    that's absolutely true. Uh, there's, ah, stable paycheck. That's also right there
    is exploring different parts of the country that all of that is absolutely true.
    And you'll check all those boxes. Um, What I have found that the preconception
    that I had coming in that hasn't been true is, um Well, I want to say the fitness,
    we're all kind of fit, and I think we're generally more fit than the rest of society.
    However, I thought like you'd be big and strong and, you know, exercising every
    day. And, um, that's not quite true. In the Navy, at least it might be for the
    Army or the Marines or other services. But for the Navy, um, generally, you're
    stationed on an aircraft care and there are tons of electric of exercise equipment,
    no doubt, and you can go at five o'clock in the morning and you can see it's full.
    They also give you lots of Jim facilities that people go through all the time.
    I was in the basketball court almost everyday. However, um, it's generally not
    so required that you're exercising, um, with everybody at the whole time. My dad
    was in the Army and I actually saw his whole crew like running around the building,
    run around the camps and things, So I thought I'd have a similar experience with
    the Navy. But that's actually not true. Generally your physical fitness is more
    your own thing, and you could just get tested on it a lot.

  transcript: One of the misconceptions that I had going in was being labeled an electrician's
    mate. And even though I dealt with a lot of electrical things, you know, I was
    a mate for Electrician's, um, generally the first six months that you that you're
    in the new power school deals with, like teaching about electrician's and about
    electrical things. Electrical equipment. However, once you become a new electrical
    operator, you deal less with fixing things. Um, there's a caveat to that. If you
    go on a submarine, then they don't have regular electrician's. There are only
    nukes Nuke Electrician's. So then you're you're fixing laundry machines and changing
    lights and, uh, changing out pumps. And you know, there's there's only so many
    people on that ship. So you're expected to do everything, however, on an aircraft
    care, which is where I was, um, other electrician's. They take care of everything
    above the plants below the plants. There aren't that many, um, really complicated
    electrical things that you have to fix. Our goal was just toe maintain things.
    So there's a turbine generator. You take off everything, you dust it off, you
    increase it up and you put it back. If there is something broken. Oh, yeah, You
    know, the they tend toe pull in and they take off the whole entire machine and
    put a whole new contraption on it. So I I didn't get so much of fixing things,
    but I did become a much better operator. That's the difference that that I found
    being a nuclear electrician's mate.

  transcript: some things that I'm doing right now that I never thought that I would
    be doing, um, you can take the last place that I was on the USS Blue Ridge now
    being ah, nuclear electrician's mate. I was basically in the plants for the most
    time, for the most part, and, you know, kind of supervising down there. And I
    hadn't done that for about eight years. So I thought, Well, once I joined the
    reserves, Well, that's gonna be one of last times that I'm actually dealing with,
    like, controlling what gets fixed and how it gets fixed. But yeah, I just recently
    on the USS Blue Ridge, I found myself even as reserve chief, overseeing a group
    of 15 electrician's, and we actually were in charge of fixing the whole entire
    ship from the bottom of the hole all the way to the top. Massive antenna. Um,
    I was in the radar room. I was in the navigation room. I was up on Vulture's row.
    I was dealing with how to fix the didn't fix the helicopters, but how to do the
    electrical checks on the helicopters. These are things that I never thought that
    I would be, um, uh, that I would have to deal with. But, um, the Navy Reserve
    actually gives you an opportunity to deal with things that you that air new. As
    long as you have some of the prior leadership qualities. And as long as you know
    some basics about it. Electricity deal with electricity things, then, um then
    they could put you anywhere.

    and more. So I began probably with around like, nine or 10 hour workdays, and

    solid workday. So, for instance, now, um, for a normal workday, I could work,
    like maybe 12 or 13 hours. Whereas when I started, it was like, nine. But, um,
    what's more important is the type of work that you do. So when you first come

    I'm going to school for computer science, and I'm hoping that that degree will

  transcript: currently. I'm not married. That doesn't mean I'm not looking. I got
    married pretty young. I think I was 24 or something like that. And e got married
    for the same reason that everybody else does. Um, my wife was, uh, model in my
    eyes. You know, she loved me a lot. I was really good friends with her family,
    and I thought that that was a good reason to get married. However, um, I think
    the only reason that you should be married is you have someone who's supportive
    of you, and you expect to grow old with them. And I don't think that that was,
    uh, the reason that I got married. We were married for eight years and we broke
    up a lot. We, uh we were separated a lot. I think we got married. And then pretty
    soon after that, I I went on deployment. By the time it came back from deployment,
    we were already separated. We got back together. Um, but then, of course, I go
    to another state, and her kids were in school in California. I was in Washington,
    Um, another separation once I got out of the navy, Um, then I finally came back
    to California and we tried again. And that's when our personalities, uh, really
    living with each other. You find out that, you know, like, um, maybe two people.
    I need more time to grow together instead of just, uh, delving into the relationship.
    You need to become a boyfriend and girlfriend first and way had to tackle some
    of that. We tried again after I was started going to college. You know, that's
    ah, house with three bedrooms and, um, trying to get her a job and then you start
    toe, see that it's being married is one of the most important decision that you
    make in your life. And I think I would have benefit benefited from thinking about
    who I was getting together with.

  transcript: being a student here at the Naval Postgraduate School. They tend to
    work you a lot. Um, maybe about four hours, at least per day for lectures. And
    then you're gonna have about two hours mawr of homework. Now, if you cut it off
    at that time, then you're your grades. They tend to be pretty generous with grades,
    but you don't. You're not gonna learn as much as you could have if you like, double
    that amount of time. So if you are working about 12 hours per day, which I think
    some days are, then that gives you about, like, four or five hours per day toe,
    um, kind of do your own thing. Your weekends are always free.

  transcript: one of the problems that I found when I was doing undergrad is that
    I'd always, um, study. And then as soon as word got out or school got out, then
    I immediately go home and try to do my homework there. Sometimes you would find
    in the library sometimes you'd see me hanging out in groups and and with friends.
    But for the most part, I tried to do work at home. Um, I learned a lot, but I
    found it Mawr productive to do things. Um, the way that I did it in the Navy when
    I was going through the nuclear nuclear propulsion school. Um, there you're not
    allowed to take any books home with you. You have your dormitory, but because
    the books are confidential, you tend a study while you're there and because we
    didn't have ah, access toe laptops there, um, it was straight studying You just
    open your book and you read and you do your homework and there's nothing else
    you take a snack or something like that. So I'm trying to get back to that. So
    even though now I, um, I am allowed to bring the books home at the Naval Postgraduate
    School. I tend to stay there until the library closes it at 8 p.m. And then I
    come home. And then at that point that I'm free. Then I try not to study it all.

    you know you're gonna just stay there longer, so it's better to get it done quicker
    than later. Um, as a supervisor, though, like, things are slightly different.
    Of course, you want the work to be done, uh, immediately, but you see everything
    that's on your plate so you actually want to do to be most efficient with your

    household goods, then how am I gonna get all the boxes, uh, to the place to my
    new location. Where are they gonna be sent? That's something that a lot of people
    don't I don't think about like if there's some kind of distance, if you have some
    kind of like you might need to get it from that place to your new location, you
    might need a truck. You might need a U haul, or they might send it yourself. Um,
    those could be overlooked if if you used to do in a certain way, you can think
    about your kids. Um, their new school. Do you need to talk to the teachers? Do

    to Japan if you have your license. Um, just as long as you have the list of items
    and you check each one by one, um, thinking about the place that you're going
    to, then you shouldn't have any problems.

    items that you need to have ready the main ones being your uniforms. You know,
    once you have your uniforms, you can basically go anywhere and then everything
    else can come later. But it's the things that come later. Those are the things
    that make life good or bad in that place. So, um, you might want to talk to somebody
    else who's actually done the deployment to the same place that you're going to
    or you can get in contact with someone who's already there to kind of get an idea
    about what else you need. Things like that could be, um, your personal items if
    you play video games if you have a TV. If you have, um, some cooking habits that
    that you want to be shipped over there, um, there's a long list of items, um,
    that you can get help for either locally or from your new command.

  transcript: military vacation is, uh, well needed. Rest from all the work that you've
    been doing. Especially if you just came back from deployment. I remember some
    of my vacations Where, um, maybe two weeks. And that's when I I would drive from
    a South Carolina toe Michigan, and just hang out. Just leave the Navy behind.
    I think I spent another, um, semester learning another language in Monterey. I
    took a flight, and then I think I spent maybe, uh, 2.5 months from saved up leave
    toe to go and you know, like just leaving behind, learn another language and then
    come back. So you get about a month every single year of of saved up leave. If
    you go like 33 years or four years, um, then that can start to accumulate. So
    generally they expect you to take about two weeks per year. But if you talk to
    the right people and especially if if you're on a downtime at your current command,
    then you can extend it. Like I said, I actually went to college for a while as
    well. So you just have toe being good communication with your supervisors.

  transcript: I've been in the Navy for 20 years, and I picked up many awards during
    that time. You generally get an award or a ribbon every two or three years, and
    these are the ones that I've received so far. They're labeled in order of precedence
    from the top to the bottom at the very top. I have, ah, Navy achievement mental
    now. And this is generally the highest award that most people most enlisted people
    get. I got this one for being a shipyard superintendent at my last command. Sassa
    Bill. Um, the shipyard was going through an intense availability at the time,
    and I did quality work there. On the next road down, you can see that I have meritorious
    unit commendation amok. And this is when I was on the USS John C. Stennis. The

    to me, because I did something very difficult in a really fast way. Um, but other
    awards, uh, they they come just from being on the team, and the leadership generally
    Davies it out. So if you don't get an award and you think that you should get
    award, I say you just bide your time. And as long as people know you as someone

    That said, um, you can add your own flavor to it. So we all learn that we treated

    of the counseling that we ever do Now, The leadership that we do, um that is unique
    has a has to do with our personality. So I like to be generally friendly and fun

  transcript: one thing I do really well as a leader is I listen, and I'm not quick
    to excitement. I remember there was one time that my commanding officer, my officer
    in charge, was really chewing me out, you know? And there was another person,
    um, in other room who is listening on. And I guess I I think I let everybody leave,
    you know, um, and we still needed toe, have some things done. And I let him, you
    know, like, have his have his words with me, Um, and toward the end, because I
    just sat there, you know, with my hands behind my back. Yes, sir. No, sir. And
    very, very careful with my words. Um, so I see kind of realized like, yeah, maybe
    he's kind of pushing me, and I'm here to help him rather than hurt him. So the
    end of our conversation was Yes. I'll get right on that, sir. And then I finished
    it. And that person, he was a first class at the time, you know, he tapped me
    on the shoulder and said, Boy, you know, I've never seen something like that.
    And the way that you handled yourself was so impressive. I don't know. I could
    have done that. You know, I think most people that were in that position would
    have been very defensive and started, you know, going back and forth. Maybe he
    had an argument, would have had an argument. But that's not what I do. That's
    not how I roll. So I think once the commanding officer, you know, once he got
    his frustration with the unit out of the way, he said, You know what? This person
    can actually help me, um, put him on my team rather than attack him, and we actually
    got the work done. So that first class actually became a chief. And I'm hoping
    that, um, that that model that I gave him will direct him and with his future,
    his future interactions with his leadership as well.

    time are really small things that we do that really, um, make the day to day operation
    run smoothly. We got to get people on their 80 s. We have to make sure that the
    training is up to date. We have to make sure that everyone has their medical.
    You know, those are the things that the commanding officers really, really depend

    30% complete on medical. Oh, that's a red flag. You know, we need to get on that,

    he was really good at his job, and he expected other people to realize that he
    was getting a job. But the fact is that he wasn't. Now I'm not the best at everything.
    Um, the thing is, I realized what I'm good at and what I'm not. As a chief, you
    always have to present, you know, expertise. But, um, every chief knows that they're
    not, and where our power comes from is that we can get the resource is to get
    the correct information. The first time I started doing evaluations, I didn't
    really know I was reading the manual, and it's ah, you know, like, couple 100
    pages long, and I have to get this done in a week or two. Um, I actually needed
    to go talk to other chiefs toe, help me make the correct decisions to make sure
    that, uh, that I have everything written down correctly. Now, when it's asked
    me. Hey, you know what? Can you do these evils? My answer is yes. My answer is
    always gonna be Yes. And it's not because, yes, I have that information. It's
    yes, I know how to get the information and you will have the correct product by
    the end of my journey. Eso If you can't really do that, then, um if you can't
    really self introspect on what you're good and what you're bad at, then you're
    gonna have a bad time. But if you can, then, um, yeah, that's that's on your way
    to be a good leader.

  transcript: the most important factors of a situation that you have to consider.
    Um, of course, it depends on what thing you're talking about. If you're talking
    about a job, then, um, let's say there's a casualty. You have to look at the severity.
    You have to look at how many people are there? Um, if it's, ah, conversation,
    you have to look at the, um, the personal, the personality of the person that
    you're talking to. Um, Is it someone who's gonna tend to cry? Is that someone
    who's gonna be emotional? Um so whatever situation you're looking at, um, just
    think about the past and think about the way that you can, um, do the right thing
    without getting without making the situation worse. Um, that's what we as chiefs
    tend to do most of the time, were moderators, right. Um, there could be two people
    arguing, and we're the type of people have to be the type of person that can come
    in and break up a fight. Now, people do that in high school, you know, and like,
    if you were the type of person that could, like, grab a person to the left, to
    the right say, Hey, think about it. You know, then, um then you could be a chief.
    I'm not saying that you have to be able to do that as a as a chief, but there's
    some power being e seven and above, right. You could get in trouble if you try
    to attack me, or you can lose your rank, you can lose your money. Right? So it
    doesn't really matter what type of chief you are. You could be the newest chief
    on board. You could have been achieved for, like 20 years for 10 years. And no
    matter what most of the enlisted people respect you respect your rank, respect
    your authority. So you have some power toe to break things up and toe, make the
    situation correct When you're doing counseling, uh, they respect your words. Um,
    it's because of all the chiefs that have come before us that have put that situation,
    um, into the navy, So

    good to make them laugh if you're up there, you know, presenting to the unit and
    you can make people start banging on the desk and laughing and stuff, you know?
    Then then your winner in their eyes. You know, that gives you a little bit of
    space to make some mistakes and have them say I you know, it's fine. Um, if you
    are so strict all the time, then you know you don't build that communion that's
    necessary, toe. Have a good relationship. Also, put your experience in there so
    there's gonna be, let's say, for instance, so many trainings that you're gonna
    be doing. And it's gonna say, Well, um, drunk driving and the power plant slide
    is gonna be there, and you're gonna have people like looking off into the into
    the wild. But as a chief every now and then, you know, you assert your authority
    by, um, you know, you know, interrupting the first class is giving the training
    and saying, Hey, you know what, Um, unit. In my experience, I had this experience,
    um, one of my friends he got busted for drunk driving. He was fined $10,000 and
    he got busted down one. And he was a good friend of mine. And this is what happened
    to him, X, y and Z, you know, So if you would have done this, it would have been
    better. Continue with your story. If you put little spices like that little pieces
    like that in whatever you're doing, being counseling, be it training, be it even
    just jogging. You know, you just mentioned something that's happening or you have
    your own, like little flavor off a ditty that you can do. Then everyone's gonna
    respect you a little bit more, I think.

    like that, that second class could be right. That's because there's been, ah,
    big boosting knowledge recently. Um, we have the Internet. We have smarter people
    coming in. We have, ah, bigger, bigger pool of people to work with. So you can't

    that's number one for most of the work that we do, You're supposed to go change
    your pump. There should never be any loud voices unless it's laughter. Right.
    So when you hear someone saying that was my wrench or you're not supposed to go
    there or you're gonna get shocked, there's something like that. There's some kind
    of argument, you know, um, if you just hear that from the corner of Ah, here,
    You know, um, just walking around and you hear some loud noises, then obviously,
    you need to go and check it out. Another thing that could be a warning sign is
    silence. So the exact opposite of that if someone's just dead silent, obviously
    they might not wanna work with the person that they're gonna go work with. Or
    they could have had an issue, like earlier on in the day that you might wanna,
    like, figure out, um, those could be safety safety issues, right? If they don't

    it depends on the personality. But I think one tried and true trick is toe kind

    and say, Just ask him. You know what's really going on? Um, you lay out the what
    you think are the issues, what you think are the problems. Well, you know what?
    Like you've been coming in late three times in a row. Um, you missed this assignment.
    Um, What's going on? And now they can correct you and say, it's not like that
    or they can give you the responses. It's up to you to decide whether the responses
    are correct or not. But you can attack those issues, right? And find out. Hey,
    it's actually a family issue or hey, it's actually, um, the fact that that person
    doesn't like another person in the unit, and they had an argument that you hadn't
    heard about. So you need toe. Um, step away from the chief aspect for a moment,
    because if you still have it on, it's like, Hey, I'm a chief. You need to tell
    me what's going on then. They're just gonna be just by the book. But if you want
    to get into their personality, if you want to get to the real reason that they're
    having the issue, you kind of talk to them as a person. You never truly give up
    your chief, Um, your chief rank. You know, they still they still maintain that
    distance. But you want to, um, let them know number one? You can be a friend to

    You're not gonna be lazy anymore. If you do it again, then you know, like the
    result is gonna come. But when it when it violates the prior agreement, you as
    the chief can actually, um, use your power to, like, kind of over over overlay
    those rules and, you know, do the right thing instead of the by the book thing.

  transcript: So as ah, reserve electrician's mate Chief, I recently went to the USS
    Blue Ridge. I was in the electrical department and I was in charge of this of
    a group of maybe I'm 15 electrician's who we were going through this really intense
    program. It's called unserved, and they hadn't been in chief there in the unit
    for a long time. So basically the, uh, second class in the first class classes
    that were there, they were actually running the unit. And to tell the truth, without
    a chief there, it had gotten a little out of hand. Um, there's a lot of gun decking
    going on. There's a lot of gun decking is when you say that you're supposed to
    do with some work, but you actually don't do it or you don't do it correctly or
    you don't do it completely. Um, there had been, uh, I guess lots of lots of team
    members like leaving throughout the day and then coming back later on, and you
    don't really know where they are, you know, chances are they could have been in
    Iraq. They could have been just walking around the ship or on the flight deck
    you know, not really working, You know, their mind and things like that going
    on. And they hadn't been corrected for a long time for for many months. You know,
    there's only one officer in the unit, and she couldn't really look at the whole
    entire unit. So when I once I came there, um, I have to correct those things.
    And so one of the things that I wanted to do was say, Well, we should write down
    all the things that we're gonna be doing with little boxes and and once they get
    complete, then we check the boxes off. And they were very adamant against that.
    At least the the first class and second class leadership that was there. Um, that's
    because that's kind of like going into their field. It's like, well, you know,
    micromanaging. But it's not micromanaging, you know, like I I I've done the same
    at my university. I've done the same with all of the other units that I've been
    with, you know, so and I think it really works. It really helps the leadership
    know exactly what's going to be accomplished. Tells a unit what we're expecting
    of them, and it allows us to keep track throughout the rest of the day. So I was
    pretty adamant about wanting to do that. And, um, the first class and second class
    is did not want to do that, just like we'll get it done at our own pace. Don't
    worry about it. New Chief. So that was Ah, point of conflict. Um, yeah. It was,
    uh, strong words there, and eventually it I had to go into the friend zone and
    try toe work with them as a team rather than this, you know, super strict, chief
    to get it done and eventually was done my way. But it didn't come without a price.

  transcript: So I had just given the story about, um, my time on the USS Blue Ridge.
    I was a new chief there, and the unit was basically run by some of the younger
    1st and 2nd class petty officers. We had some kind of conflict because, um, it
    was very lax in the unit, and I had to bring it up toe up to par. That being said,
    they they were being really, really overworked. And I think that's part of the
    reason that they were, um, being lax because there was no really strong figure
    toe view them. And when you come in, when you supposed to come in at seven o'clock
    and your going to Iraq around, like 10 or 11 every single day Saturdays and Sundays
    included, then of course, you know, if if no one's like, you know, happening you
    of your back, then you're gonna, like be easy. Nobody wants to work 12, 13, 14,
    15 hours per day every single day, right. So, um, in order to get the unit toe
    where it needed to be, that's actually what they should have been doing that,
    that we had that schedule so we could make it on time. And, yeah, it required
    13, 14, 15 hours per day. Um, but that's because they weren't working at 100%
    efficiency. They weren't even working at 60% efficiency, right? So the response
    to that was, we'll just keep working on harder, and I didn't want to do that.
    I actually wanted to make them more efficient, but also give them more time. So
    my goal was, Hey, you know what? Let's First of all, let's stop working them so
    hard, give them more reasonable hours. Once they see that we're giving them a
    little bit of more freedom. Hopefully then they'll up their game to, you know,
    So it's kind of like the chicken and egg. Uh, we're not gonna give them freedom
    until they start working harder. And I want to do the opposite. I want to give
    them freedom so that they could work harder. So that's where my issues and the
    and the units on the upper leaderships issues kind of conflicted. But we found
    a solution

    did their job correctly. You're putting your hands in some breakers, and you're
    not gonna have all the electrician's all check the same exact panel, right? So
    you just have to depend on them to do their job correctly s so that you don't
    get electrocuted. For the most part, I I didn't really trust too much that that's
    just a general, um, general thing with me, because I I've seen some some shady
    stuff in the past, and I just tend to not trust so much. But, uh, there's a point,
    you know, there's a point that, you know, what if they're all the panels are off

    person that actually read the tag correctly, right? Those are all trainings that
    we've had in the past. So You just have to assume that, um they read it correctly.
    They did their job correctly. Uh, they're gonna operate the equipment correctly.
    And now you are, uh, piggybacking off of that and and continue the work based
    on what they did.

  transcript: I'm an electrician's mate. Chief. The electrician's mate means that
    I'm an expert, um, for electrical operations for electrical maintenance. Um, I
    think that I can handle that pretty well. I'm a chief, which means that, um, I
    handle the unit. I handle the operations that we do the minutes that we do, but
    also, um, the day to day, um, activities. So if they need training, um, if they
    need other things like that Now, what I'm not an expert in is anything outside
    of that. So, for instance, security. You put it up to the security manager, Um,
    let the experts do their job and specifically sexual things. Um, um, emotional
    things for the sexual part. We have the victim's advocate. We have the, uh, sexual
    assault coordinator. Um, you refer your people to them for the psychological.
    We have the psychological health operation specialists. You referred to them,
    you know, like things dealing with suicide as soon as you hear it. Um, that that
    someone might be considering that. Say, Well, you know, as a chief, that's where
    my role ends. You know, he's in my unit. My goal from that point on is to make
    sure that that person is safe because as electrician's, you know, safety is number
    one always on my mind and then get that person to the correct, um, psychological
    health outreach person. So, um yeah, other than the obvious ones, it's a case
    by case thing. Um, if people are belligerent, you have to realize, like whether
    you can handle that in house or if you have to send that up to the to the MPs,
    um, think things like that.

  transcript: if I'm in a situation that, um something is amiss, and I didn't cause
    it, Um, a lot of times you're still gonna be blamed for it. Anyways, you just
    realize that's the way that it is. It's always been like that at every single
    command that have had. Um, it's even like that in the civilian world. So number
    one don't take it to heart. No one's gonna be blaming U. S. Oh, that's wrong.
    They will blame you, Right? But in the end, everyone realizes that you're human
    as well. And especially the officers they can kind of see whether it's your fault
    or not. You know, like as a chief, you could say, Well, we didn't get this maintenance
    done. Um, it's up on. The folks will super, far, far in the front. And I've been
    in the galley in the kitchen all day with this 111 thing the officer can say,
    Well, you know what? The folks of things should have been done. And it's your
    fault, Chief. And the wrong answer is to say, it's not my fault. I wasn't there.
    No chief will ever answer that way. The correct response is well the officer is
    not actually blaming me. He's the one who sent me to the galley to fix things,
    but it's his responsibility to make sure that it gets done. And he hasn't put
    some blame somewhere, right, because you know, it wasn't correct. So the blame
    has to go somewhere. But he's not blaming me. He's not blaming me. The chiefly
    leader, right? Um, s o just accept the fact that the thing wasn't done and then
    find out where the blame should be. Should be focused, right? And then creek that
    that problem. But don't take it to heart. Don't take the complaints against you,
    Toe heart. If it is your fault, then of course, fess up to it, you know? But if
    it's not your fault, don't place the blame in other places. The goal is find out
    where the blame is and then correct it there without being so defensive about
    it.

  transcript: people leave the Navy for a lot of different reasons. I left the Navy
    the active duty Navy, because I wanted to have ah, college career at the school
    of my choice, studying what I wanted to. And that really wasn't a Knop shin for
    me When I was in the military, they wanted me to study nuclear engineering at
    a certain school, um, in a certain part of the country and actually wanted to
    do something different. I'm still in the Navy, you know, part time. But it's not,
    you know, active duty. Um, another reason is that people would leave the military
    is because it's not designed for them. You know, we try to snuff those people
    out during boot camp, but we don't get everyone. Um, you still have people who
    are just, um uh, complainers who are aren't good workers who don't work well with
    other people in in teams. Eso those kinds of things, they actually come out when
    you're working for the 2nd and 3rd and 4th year. And to tell you truth, it will
    probably be the best interest of the Navy that they're not there. That's a safety
    issue, or that's an efficiency issue. Um, so it's better to get those people out
    so they don't want to be here and to tell the truth, like the Navy confined other
    people that can replace them. Eso people that don't wanna be here, people that
    wanna a different career for wanna go to college. Um, maybe this was just, um,
    to set themselves up in life. Like even if I didn't want to go to college, I would
    still probably thank the Navy for the skills that they gave me and then continue
    on toe like a higher paying job in the outside world. And there's places for people
    like that. In fact, the Navy actually came up with a new retirement system called
    the Blended Retirement System, which, um, is focusing on the people who know that
    they're not gonna have a 20 year career. Um, for the people that are gonna be
    in for 46 years, they say, Hey, you know what? We'll set you up with your life.
    You be a veteran, you get these experiences, you conserve the country and thank
    you for being on our ship. In the end, we'll give you the Montgomery G. I. Bill
    or the post 9 11 bill. A zit is now and we'll give you some cash. Um, for your
    retirement that you can use later on. So it depends on what you want. And, um,
    yeah, there's so many different reasons that I could list them all.

    to see how he's doing it in the morning, at least for Electrician's. They're going

  transcript: something else that you need to know, especially uh, when it's concerning
    leaders is that you have to be the role model, and I know that's cliche, but you
    have to keep in top physical forum. There'd be sometimes when I'm when I was a
    second class or third class and we look at some of the Chiefs and you know they're
    around big guys, you know? And although they're very well respected, obviously,
    you know, they became chiefs and and, you know, we go to them all the time for
    our problems. Uh, in the back of our minds were just thinking, Well, why isn't
    this person in shape that's always at the back of our minds? As a leader, you
    have to be the role model. You have to be in the top 10% of all the runners. You
    have to be the guy cheering people on. You can't be the guy that people are worried
    about, right? Um, even even though if it might be true, obviously everybody can
    have their own problems and stuff, you know. But when you're projecting your leadership
    on other people, they have to be the lower ones and going up to you, and it hasn't
    always be that way. Um, maintain your military bearing, right, Uh, for any of
    the chiefs that that that I've seen that were wrinkled or creased or something
    like that, um, you're always gonna compare them to the hot shot first class that
    that's there, and you're gonna make that comparison and you never wanna be underneath.
    Ah, first class. Uh, if you if you're a chief for above, um, if you have a hot
    shot, then you have to be a hotshot to they have to see like, Hey, you know what?
    That chief is the one who made that first class be that way. So, um, a Sfar is
    your physicality ous faras your uniforms assed faras your speech as far as your
    connection, whether the people, as far as your quickness to anger all of those,
    have to be, um, at the at the top of their game. And I know it's a lot, but you're
    gonna have many years to prepare many years to practice, And they're gonna be
    other chiefs out there who wanna make sure that, um, all your tiny little problems,
    um, are chipped away, edged away at until you're a military model of a leader

    why. I guess I recognized the name from, um Steppenwolf author and stuff. And
    I read the back of Siddhartha. Maybe something interesting, kind of thin. And
    I was blown away. I was It felt like I was the kid from the never ending story
    who, like, had a school and then went up to the attic real quick to keep reading.
    And I felt like I was in the novel. I felt like he was talking to me. Even though
    it's like, maybe hey wrote the novel like what, 50 years before that, Um, like,
    halfway through the novel, I felt like How am I gonna end? How how do I, uh how

    of my own life. And that's the first time I have actually really, really read
    a novel where I thought, Man, the guy writing This is a genius. The guy that's
    writing this is like is breaking down his intelligence into away that's digestible.

    are great. Um, the first time I actually saw blood in cartoons and most anime.
    Many enemy are designed for adults rather than humans but adults rather than kids.
    But really that novel that it's like a novel, it Z like you're watching a novel.
    But there's so many elements of theirs. Graphic violence, which is great. But
    the main character, one of the main characters, is so charismatic, Um, actually
    wanted to serve in his army. He was like, uh, this white cared, um um, night.
    Basically, who, like was tryingto get his castle and just listening to his words
    just like poetry on paper. And I said, Wow, if I was back in the medieval times,
    I'd follow this guy. You know, leaders can actually, like, watch this movie and
    understand how to become better leaders by by acting like him. Of course, he,
    uh, his situation is interesting, and I won't give away the movie away the movie
    for anybody that wants to watch it. But between the romance and the violence and
    the charm. Um, it has everything that you want in a blockbuster film and the fact
    that it's so long, you know, it's like, uh, maybe you would take eight hours and
    nine hours to watch it That just made it all the more better.

    passed away, um, several years ago, which is, ah, tragedy. But if I could have,
    uh, had some coffee with him, or maybe drink some soccer with him, just chatted.
    I think that would have been great. So, uh ah, person in the past Herman Hess.

  transcript: some of the main challenges that I faced when I started, uh, going through
    my educational career was, um I mean, I I didn't have the most money. My mother
    wasn't working to regularly. My my sister was on welfare and she had three kids
    of her own. And, um, yeah, I didn't have all the basic necessities. It didn't
    really bother me too much because, like, I didn't feel like I needed, um, many
    things, But yeah, we didn't have a car most of the time riding around on the bus
    on many occasions, didn't have enough money for, um, for paying for things that
    school food was basically free. You know, I don't think that I ever wanted for
    food. I just didn't eat that much. So I wasn't that hungry. School was in the
    morning, and at night time we had enough, um, food on the table, so that wasn't
    a big problem. But it's more for things that make you a better person through
    life, For instance, like having enough money toe go to the theater or having some
    cash for your local comic book. You know, I didn't have those those type of things.
    Um, Christmas time was, uh, they give you some gloves, and that was among some
    other things. You know, they they tried and not gonna complain. You know, I had
    a good life. I had a loving family, so I'm not gonna push that too hard. But your
    basic material things was something that I think would have given me a bit a better
    or a different perspective. Uh, coming up through the, uh, through the years,
    I was young, um, and obviously, like, growing up like this By the time I let's
    say, got to the navy, I don't think that I had a very strong work ethic. I did
    come and I did learn I was in the nuclear propulsion field and I think someone
    who had a different lifestyle, for instance, you know, they had their standard
    1300 s a t know that their tutors coming coming through it. Not all of them were
    like that, but just a few. I think that they probably had, ah, better a better
    quality of education while they were through the program. Whereas for me, you
    know, I Yeah, sure. I read the book sometimes, and I tried to understand as much
    as I could, but I didn't have the basic electron ICS to give me that preparation.
    You know, I didn't know what a ground was. I I barely knew what current was like.
    I had to understand everything from the very, very beginning. When I think some
    of those things I should have gotten through public education through the books,
    I would have read if I would have been a good student or through the training,
    I would have gotten, you know, had I been a better student in school. Um, so the
    good thing about the Navy is they do start you off on on an even playing field
    like you. We expect that you know nothing. They expected people like me, which
    was which was excellent. So I'm just saying I didn't become the superstar right
    out the gate actually had toe put in. I think all the effort that I should have
    in high school in, um in school and, you know, I took the challenge and that was
    successful.

  transcript: The most challenging part of my job is probably the most important as
    a military person in general. And that's taking ownership of whatever it is that
    you're doing, especially in new school. You actually have toe go to the library,
    get the steam propulsion manual and start reading, you know, left and right. You
    don't know something's And yeah, you have some access to other people who know
    where the material is, But they actually like force you to do a lot of research
    on your on your own to do the homework on your own. I don't think Yeah, After
    you start getting a certain G p a like 3.8 Onda above which I had, they don't
    even expect you to do homework. They just have the tests and say here, you know,
    you you study night and day Do do baby sit you, um, in a school toe degree. So,
    for instance, if you're not doing well, you know, you have, like, less than three
    point? No. Then you have an extra 20 to 40 hours extra that they expect from you.
    I'm I'm assuming that other, um, eight schools are similar, but maybe not that
    intense. You know, maybe the material isn't quite as dense, but, um, they do hold
    your hand through the education. You only have yourself to blame if you don't
    go through that. But after the two years of a school, uh, then they let you free.
    You're free to go and especially nukes. They expect you toe, you know, be smart
    to accept the training. Some of its really dense and you, you know, way above
    your grade. Your pay grade. So, um, especially the first year, too. They're talking
    about the top of the, um, aircraft carried all the way to the bottom, to the left
    and right. And, you know, the electrons that go into it, the things that they
    need to purchase and how the Cellini cell works on the inside. And, you know some
    of those things you you barely glossed over in a school. But now they're giving
    you an in depth, um, rundown of each thing and it, you know, it just goes over
    your head. But the fortunate thing is, you don't have to memorize those things.
    I think a lot of it is just they just want you to have some experience with it.
    And after two years or three years, then you become a pro. And there's this, like
    path that you're supposed toe, you know, adhere to the whole entire time for you
    to become that pro. Um, so when you're going through it at the at the very, very
    beginning, you're you're not sure about how much you're supposed toe ingest. Technically,
    you could spend all watch just reading all books, which is what they expect you
    to do, which is what they tell you to dio, um, you could spend, um, you know,
    hours after your eight hour workday just still reading and still not read enough.
    You know, it's an infinite amount of material that should be covered. That's gonna
    help you get promoted on the test. You know, the higher your score like, let's
    say, um, you score really well and then you will be promoted based on, like the
    percentage that you score above other people. So, yeah, the cool thing is, there's
    a there's a range for everyone. So if you don't score pretty well, then you know
    you get promoted a little bit slower. And if you do, um, just read nonstop constantly,
    then their path for you to become an officer toe get promoted early. So, um yeah,
    As long as you take ownership of yourself, then I think that that's probably one
    of the most challenging things that you have is a military person in the new field.

  transcript: the biggest failure that I ever had, which I think about even all the
    time to this day is trying to get into the Naval Academy from doing two years
    in the new school and not being accepted. I I was putting forth my full effort
    every single weekend or maybe every other weekend. You know, depending you'd have
    some test on Monday. And I remember just not really understanding all the new
    material that that that week and just being totally confused. But I remember just
    going in as soon as Friday. The bell hit, you know, just stand at the library.
    Read, read, read. Going dinner. Come back, read, read until they kick you out,
    I think midnight or something. Um, Saturday was, you know, you wake up in the
    morning, maybe you exercise. Maybe you like, uh, eat some breakfast, and then
    you go in and you're there until midnight. You don't go anywhere else. Um, that
    Saturday was full of white boards and writing paper until my finger had, like,
    calluses on it. And then the Sunday would, um, would be more like, you know, review
    of what I did. I probably teach other people and that actually helped myself.
    Um, pretty much the whole day. And I wouldn't go home until I was sure that I
    would get a four point on the next test. Um, I think I got a four point at once,
    but the point is that I was I was confident in all of my answers. Um, So I did
    that for two years because to tell you the truth, I wasn't really interested in
    the in nuclear propulsion actually want to be a cryptologist. But I heard that
    this program, which I wasn't familiar with it had lots of math and science, and
    he transferred fluid flow in chemistry. It had all of that. And I thought that
    that would be a really good way Thio cover those things that I didn't in high
    school and prepared before the, you know, the intensive Naval Academy. So at at
    that two year point when I applied, I was, you know, had a really high G p a.
    I had a pretty good recommendations from all of my officers. Um, it came back,
    rejected, and I was actually surprised. Um, later on, the x o of the academy called
    me out of the blue I was studying, you know, kind of like, you know, like, um
    frustrated. And he called me and he said, Hey, you know, like, um, I just want
    to let you know, Like we saw your, uh, your application and, you know, we have
    some chit chat, and he said, Well, you know what? Like I think I'm gonna send
    you to boost, you know, because like, you're an excellent candidate, by the way,
    Um and then I told him I'm sorry. I'm, uh, past the age. I was 22 but I would
    would have been 23 by the time. And that's the cut off. And, you know, that was
    that was surprising to him. You know, I think it was prepared to like Cindy, and
    and he said, Well, what's honestly, you know, what was the case? Why did you choose
    your major? So he basically told me why I was rejected. I actually chose economics
    instead of engineering. Um, Major And I told him that, you know, I think I give
    some answer that I wanted to, like, learn languages. And I didn't think that it
    really mattered what major you did as long as you know, like you're gonna just
    learn leadership and other, um, military qualities at the academy. And he said,
    Yeah, actually, were we expect engineers, uh, you know, computer science, mechanical
    engineering, electrical engineering. You know, those those are the main ones that
    we wanted. So, yeah, we parted ways and I didn't get accepted. And that that was
    first time I've ever, ever really tried something other than tracking cross country
    in high school. But, um, academically, that's the first time I've ever put forth
    my full effort at something and then didn't get accepted. That's my biggest failure.

    when I was at Berkeley and I didn't go home and read all the chapters. You know,
    they say, like, this is how you succeed, you know, read this and do this, you
    know? And I didn't really push myself as hard as I should have. And that lasted
    my whole career. Sometimes I did. You know, sometimes I was, you know, during
    the weekend, I just like reading, reading code and code. But other weekends, I
    just, you know, like I got a C or a B on a test. And, you know, like, I feel like,
    Hey, you know what? I should have really pushed myself a little bit harder during
    that time. But the failures that I have currently are the ones that are that I'm
    most unhappy with Andi. This means as a chief, um, you have people under you and
    I I felt them all the time. I try it. You know my hardest. I tryto get them awards
    and they don't get accepted for I try to get them promoted and they don't get,
    um, the the credit that they that they want. I try to write the most fair evaluation
    that I that I can and some of the ones that have the lower ones, you know, I have
    to explain. And then they walked out the room and I say, Hey, how did you try
    to change him? Did you try to get that? You know that three point. Oh, upto a
    four point. Oh, Did you give them all the tools that were necessary so he could
    succeed? And yeah, this is constant. So, um, you're still happen all the time,
    But, you know, you live with them and you have to just think that you tried toe

    But for the most part, looking at the thing that they're asking you to do and
    then seeing the result from my experience, it seems that most of the time they
    asked you to do reasonable things in a reasonable, reasonable amount of time.
    Um, if they say you know what we need, Um, you need to do preventive maintenance
    on this pump on DWI. Give you like, two days for this. There's almost no excuse
    for why you can't do it, of course, like let's say you break your leg or let's

  transcript: a chance that I recently took when I was on annual training was at the
    USS Blue Ridge. I was the chief, the new chief in charge of making sure that we
    successfully passed our insert requirement in service. I mean, it's ah really
    comprehensive test that all the departments of the ship have to pass. And as a
    new chief, I was I was supposed Thio get all the electrician's to do all of the
    jobs that they were supposed to, and I think that they were very, very far behind.
    That's one of the reasons that I was called there and, uh, we didn't do too well.
    I think we scored in the mid range and the most of the ship. They passed pretty
    pretty well, either green or, you know, like slightly under. But our electrical
    division was just so so in that. In that respect, I think that we were working
    really hard every single day. Um, warning tonight. You know, uh, kind of directing
    some of the guys toe, go fix things and do preventive maintenance on things. However,
    we couldn't catch up from the like maybe year. That had been kind of like slowly
    keeping behind us. There were too many things to fix. Too many lights that we
    hadn't seen too many rooms that we didn't know where they were too many like bakers
    that we couldn't open once they were open, like inside. We have to, like, do some
    other things to make it work properly. And we couldn't catch up, Um, to the time,
    um, that insert was to be successful in that regard. Who did I talk to? You know,
    uh, that's the thing. You always have to have feedback to the people above you,
    your superiors, your devo, Um, even the commanding officer in this case, you know,
    I remember the commanding officer of the Blue Ridge was down with us down in the
    in the aft steering room. Um, making sure that the the I think it was some kind
    of valve that was supposed to be, um, that was affecting the engine room. He was
    there, you know, like turning a wrench with us. So as long as everyone up the
    chain knows exactly where you are and what your problems are than they're a little
    bit more forgiving for that, it's when you try to hide things. And, you know,
    you say, like, Hey, I could do it. You know, I'm a single individual or I'm the
    leader of this crew, you know, And you don't feed the information back up the
    chain. That's when they start, um, being frustrated with you. So a songs You have

  transcript: Ah, pivotal moment in my career. I think most people who are chiefs
    would say the time that they became a chief the time that they got accepted. But
    I would say that it actually came a few years before that when I when I made first
    class. Uh, that's the time that I think I've been in for maybe six years. And
    I had recently had a bolt in the road where I didn't get accepted. I missed the
    first class exam by, like, 60.1%. Um, uh, yeah, it is very, very close, you know,
    like anything, if I would have gotten an award or like maybe one more point on
    my evil, anything would have would have bump me up to the to the next rank. So
    by that next time actually took a weekend, um, and study for the exam. It's the
    first time that I did, and I remember going through the books, seeing like what
    you're supposed to study and like circling things and like on a sheet of paper,
    you know, like, um, writing down things that that I needed to memorize. It's kind
    of like a nuclear power school. I think I spent, like, eight hours per day. Um,
    for those three days. And then by the time I got the the recommendation, I think
    I scored in the top 99% of nuclear propulsion engineers, and I kind of saw you
    know what? Like the power of self studying, it actually really does. Guide, um,
    your progress. And I think I still hold on to that. I now, based on what I did
    and the amount of effort that the the positive result that I saw for myself, I
    can now confidently tell my other people Hey, you know, if you study, you will
    most likely see success. And I mean that instead of just, like, maybe, uh, chit
    chat from other people who maybe haven't studied, but just kind of say like, Hey,
    you know what it za right thing to do. So I have experience with that myself.

    to take the shipyard superintendent role in festival. Now, I have been a nuclear
    propulsion engineer for my entire career, Um, tears at school and then six years
    on an aircraft care. Um, once you stop becoming Anak, did you remember and you
    switch over from a nuke to a regular electrician's, Then you're dealing with things
    that you have never seen before and some of it's great. Um, I actually put armatures
    in for motor before I've never done that. I've actually, like dipped huge pieces
    of mechanics, uh, mechanical pieces. I've actually ran cables. I've taken out
    entire circuit breakers with civilians, you know, like all these things I've never
    seen before and and it really build your, um, build your experience. But the shipyards
    superintendent, though that's, um, after eight years of doing the reserve and
    doing electrical things, you know, things that I kind of knew about. The shipyard
    superintendent was an entirely new role. That's when you actually have to get
    out of the propulsion plant and see every single thing that there is to know about
    the ship and multiple ships, ships I've never even seen before. Um, em cm's mine
    sweepers. Um, destroyers, uh, you actually have toe go up to the navigation room
    and understand what's going on there. You have to go to the the main deck and
    the quarterdeck and, uh, you know, like fixing walls and paint. And, uh, like
    there's so many things that I had no idea about, and yet I had to learn at the
    time. And for shipyard superintendents, they don't really have a tutor in front
    of you. You actually have to, like, just hop in there and just start learning,
    you know, like asking people, What is this? What is that? You know, reading computer
    drawings and books. And it was it was pretty intense. But, you know, you step
    up to the challenge and luckily you have a good support network there. I didn't
    know about that, but I didn't realize how how good it was. And you have successful

  transcript: the Navy is really good about giving you the correct material to use
    the more dangerous job gets. I've actually been around people who have went into
    a live 41 60 volt breakers. You touch it, you're done right. Ah, friend of mine
    actually was hospitalized. And what was paraplegic for a while? Another chief
    friend of mine based on doing those things. And you're around it all the time.
    Um, but in those cases they give you and you're supposed to use all the protective
    equipment that is necessary to do the job successfully and safely. Um, so I would
    say the mawr dangerous electrical work I've done, uh, the more safe I've been.
    Ironically, it's when you start going lower down the line of risk that your danger
    actually increases. Um, the most dangerous thing I've done is just being around
    the propulsion plant, Um, and not putting in your in your hearing protection.
    You know, you do that for a couple of a couple of months, and then all of a sudden,
    you know, you start hearing ringing in your ears, that Z, that's actually pretty
    dangerous. That's not something that civilians are normally exposed to. you know.
    So it's something simple. Like just wearing your PPE is, uh, is probably the most
    dangerous I would feel. But, like physically the most like on a day basis, the
    most dangerous thing I've done is probably, um, go up to the top of one of the
    light mass. We have to change the transistor eyes, me and another guy and you
    Absolutely, where? The crack material. But sometimes, you know, you have to, like,
    take off a hook and put the other hook on, you know, and you do that multiple
    times and you realize that, you know, let's say like you're not paying attention.
    There could be a time that you're way up there and it's just 11 slight small move,
    and you're either hanging up there or you actually fall to your death. Um, so,
    yeah, that's another thing that civilians really aren't really exposed to that

    that a recent experience I was a chief in charge of in serve and we have to make
    sure that all of the electrical equipment across the whole entire ship was complete
    to satisfaction. And you send to Electrician's up there. Maybe it's a third class
    and a seaman apprentice. You send another first class here to do that job second
    class here to do that job, and you have to walk around as a chief to make sure
    that everything gets done. And there's no way that you can check every single
    thing. And yet, like you realize that if something isn't done particularly right,
    we check an automatic bus transfer and it doesn't transfer. You know that's gonna
    look bad on you on the sailor, slightly but more on the department in general,
    and it's it's kind of scary, you know, like like for most of the things I wish

    well with my civilian career. Especially because I'm considering having a federal

    Get out and you become a great soldier and you just, um you're allowed to go on

    don't wanna really experience that so much. I wanna keep serving. And one way

    Hey, took me thio these two boxes and for most of the maintenance requirement
    courage, it takes one person to kind of look, um, maybe be a safety observer and
    explain things and another person actually be in the in the in the equipment.
    And in order to do any maintenance down in the nuclear power plants, there's a
    long process. You have to get permission from the watch officer. You have to hang
    danger tags. You have to have another person go around and look at the danger
    tags you have tow. You know, say that you're ready to work. You have to go down
    to the plant and actually like, set up the proper equipment. You know, there,
    we try to make it a safe. It's possible. So he said that he had done all of the
    requested, um, you know, background stuff. And he said, Yeah, you know, like I
    just go up there. But I think I was changing a V c. I or actually, there was something
    that I had to do. Ah, electrician's wise. Um, but he had me do it now. He said
    that it was the energized and he did the de energized checks. Um, and I actually,
    like, looked at actually like, um, I think that I checked it myself, or maybe
    I didn't, but, um, I did all the all the maintenance for it. I clean the inside.
    I was exposing myself to electrical wires. And then I shut it, and I looked at
    the sheet of paper and I was actually working on the wrong breaker. So he's the
    one who actually opened it. And he said, Yeah, it's ready to go. Hey, just need
    another person. But I was actually working in ah, free electrical breaker. And
    I think it's 450 volts. Um, so I was pretty upset about that. Um, Or maybe it
    was 1 20. I'm not I'm not really sure, but yeah, that I should have never been
    in that situation. And rather than go up until the Watch officer rather than make
    a big scene about it. I, um I got really frustrated, you know? I shut the door.
    You know, I didn't yell at him or scream at him. I just said, You know what? I'm
    never gonna put myself in that situation again. I'm gonna check every single breaker,
    every single tag. I'm always gonna look read every single instruction because
    I don't trust anyone at that time. And that was wrong. I should have ratted him
    out. I should have, um, made sure that he wasn't put in, that he wasn't able to
    put other people in that situation again. And that's unethical thing that, you

    the cool thing is that I got to see all four corners of America. So my school
    was in South Carolina. Um, then I did my prototype. The school lasted about a
    year and a half. Then I did prototype for six months up in, um, upstate Albany,
    New York, Um, lots of trees and stayed in a nice house. Um, pretty close Thio
    downtown New York. Then I went to the lower left toe to San Diego and I'm from
    California. So I really enjoyed those times those three years that I was there
    half the time we were on deployment, So that's a killer. But my family was in
    Los Angeles, so I actually, like live with my family in L. A. And every single
    day I drove the hour and a half toe to my work work was from a, I think, six toe

    um, and you don't use it, um, that's that's, I think, a shame that more people

    do the work while I was on active duty. But as a reservist, we travel all the
    time. In fact, we travel every single year, so they could send me from my home
    in Los Angeles, toe Norfolk. And once I get to Norfolk, the flight there is paid
    for, Um, you can stay at a hotel, you get a certificate of non availability, which
    means that you can stay at any of the hotels off base or if they have government
    hotels on base. Then you get to stay at a nice hotel and with with maid service
    and breakfast, most likely they even pay for your car. So as long as you keep
    the receipts or you type it in tow the website, um, the travel website, Then for
    the most part, um, once you get back home, they'll give you the cash right there
    on the spot. Sometimes you're there, you're traveling and you need some cash.
    Uh, that shouldn't come from your normal paycheck. Uh, then you actually write
    a write request and they give you advanced pay. So basically, you don't have to
    really worry about money when you're traveling as long as like you write the correct
    paperwork. Um, it should all be free and paid for by the military.

  transcript: my marriage didn't work out for the same reason that I think it doesn't
    work out for a lot of, uh, new people in the Navy. Number one. I didn't really
    understand what the purpose of a marriage was for. Um, I I know there's a really
    cheesy thing to say, but, I mean, I have my father, my mother, and they divorced
    when I was young, so my mother kind of just took care of me. So my impression
    of what family waas was based on, uh, my mother, my sister who is 10 years older
    than me and her three kids. And it's a group of people that kind of take care
    of each other. Uh, maybe some people work and then they put money into the house.
    Maybe someone has a car, and then they drive people around. Um, maybe people laugh
    and joke, you know, you go to these places and that's what my impression of marriage
    waas Um, it's a group of people, um, dealing with family issues. But that's not
    the right reason to get married. I got married really young, um, in my eyes 24
    years old. And I found this, uh, this gorgeous model. Uh, she was my, um I lived
    with her for several years after I split up with my father. I was 18 years old.
    I bounced around from house to house, and eventually I moved in with my best friend.
    And, um, like, just staying with that whole entire family for years, One year,
    two years, uh, hanging out with the kids and the family and the, you know, going
    toe all these barbecues. And, you know, you develop a love for everyone in the
    house. You develop a love of strong connection. And I thought that that was, uh,
    a good way to make a family. However, when I eventually asked the like, my best
    friend at the time, she was my best friend to be married. I didn't think about
    her as you know what? Like I'm going to get old and die with this person. I was
    just thinking, You know what? Like she supported me, I support her. Um, let's
    just do it. Um, but yeah, months go by and weeks go by and you don't develop the
    same type of love that should be in a marriage. Uh, you should wanna call back,
    for instance, I'm unemployment. Um, I should really wanna call back very often
    to the home. And I was just so involved with work. Um, really, if I would've looked
    around to my left and my right, There are many husbands who would stand in line
    for, like, four hours, five hours just to call back to their to their wife. And
    that wasn't me. And I should have, you know, I should have actually, like, been
    in more contact with my wife to make it less, and I didn't. When she's asking
    me for money, I would be thinking, Well, you know, like, I'm the one who joined
    the service and this money, it actually belongs to me. You know, it's It's my
    cash. I'm working for this, you know, And that's actually the wrong way to think
    about it. You should think every single dollar that comes to me should be split
    around, you know? So I was very selfish at the time as well. Um, yeah, I could
    go on with a lot of the reasons that I'm I was a bad person to be a husband to
    at the time. Um, I think now, maybe I'm ready. Every single dollar and make should
    go to my kids in my family. Um, every single free time that I have each our free
    time that I have should go to my friends and family. And I just didn't think that
    at the time, um, she had her, um, her items of concern as well, you know, like,
    but I'm not her and yeah, it just didn't work out.

    up the rest of it until you get Thio the salary that you're looking for. The salary
    that that you're looking for is about, um, 70 to 80% off of your your monthly
    salary. That's the kind of, uh, version that I took on. You don't wanna be hitting
    your, you know, like, if you make 5000 don't wanna be, uh, be hitting 5000 every

    are and what kind of goals you're looking for. Maybe you're trying to buy a house.
    Then you should have a bigger buffer. Maybe you're just trying to buy another
    car. Smaller buffer. Maybe you said, hey, you know what? Like I'm not gonna retire

    don't have a wife, don't have any kids. And I've been focused so much with work
    that I've actually forgotten the things that are most important, which is developed,
    that family structure. It's been around me. I knew that it existed, but maybe
    I never found the right one. I used to be married before, and it was to the wrong
    person. I used to have girlfriends that were the right people, but I didn't, you
    know, take the take the bait. And here I am, you know, like ah kind of kind of
    alone. And I think that it's important for me to find someone for me to make my
    mark for me to have a kid that I can, you know, pass my legacy on to for me to
    have a wife that I can grow old with and make sure that in your naval career you
    don't forget those things. And that's one of the main things that you're fighting

    tell you the truth, my biggest inspiration comes from the past historical feature.
    Historic historical figures. I have been learning about Albert Einstein recently,
    Isaac Newton. Some of the scientists that have pushed forward quantum mechanics
    and quantum computing. Um, those guys, you realize that for the vast majority
    of of their life, they're just normal guys. They have a wife and kids and they
    watch TV just like us. They go out and buy pants and clothes and hats, but, you
    know, for ah, section of their life, they actually really put forth their full
    effort. They read the books that it takes. They talk to the people, they do the
    math, Um, and and it's not normal, you know? That's what did you do for this Friday?
    Well, I was watching Netflix and some kind of YouTube movies, but what they did
    was they. They pushed themselves forward to the limits of human understanding,
    and then they made their own mark, and those are the type of people that I find
    inspiration from the people that are changing the world.

    class. So you have a really good perspective of the whole entire ship. Um, thing
    you might become a chief, And once you becoming chief, you actually start talking
    to the officers a lot more. It's kind of like your world kind of flips up. Um,
    you can think of it like a like one of those. Our glasses and the first class
    and the chief are kind of like in the middle. And once you become a chief, you
    still have to talk to the unit, Um, some. But it's more about telling the first
    class what he supposed to do. He filters it down, and then the first class tells
    you and then you filter it up. So that's when you start becoming more administrative
    oriented. You tell the watch officer, um, what's going on the plant? What maintenance
    is being performed? Um, And in the unit, you, uh, make sure that everybody is
    on track to become promoted toe. Make sure that they're on track tow, cover all
    of their watches. And if there's some kind of problem with that, then you can
    you can you address it seeing chiefs and master chiefs. They're a little bit more
    specific. Um, so if you become a senior chief, you do a lot of the things that
    a chief also does. But you also have a little bit more on career progression.
    Um, instead of being a three m coordinator, you could be, um, someone who is in
    charge of entire departments. Not just your unit, a senior chief, because they
    expect you toe, of course, no electric, uh, electrician's stuff as a senior chief.
    But they also expect you to be very familiar with the e t stuff. Elektronik technician
    and very familiar with the mechanical stuff. Maybe you also qualified. Watch Super.
    Um, work center supervisor. I'm sorry, What supervisor and work center supervisor
    Where? Um, you actually have to understand the plant way more in depth. You could
    probably even write books about it, right? Procedures about it. Um, Master Chief,
    that's the highest that you could be the highest level that you could be, um,
    in the military. That's a level of e nine. And that's when you are so for the
    nukes, like they do have a they can't have a master chief that's in charge of
    the whole entire electrical department. But there's another master chief that's
    in charge of the whole entire nuclear section and even another master chief. They're
    all e nine who is in charge of the whole entire ship, and you could be either
    one of those. Um, it's more like lateral transfers when you're at that level,
    so yeah, to become a chief and might take about 10 years to become seeing chief
    could be like 12 or 13. To become a master chief, you could be pushing around
    20 years at that time.

  transcript: a good goal is toe. Go online, figure out your advancement path and
    make sure that you're checking all the boxes that it takes Thio get to the next
    level. So, for instance, for first class Petty Officer as an electrician's, um,
    they expect you to be a leading chief petty officer. Or at least, um, and assistant
    leading Petty officer. Other jobs could be training pair, officer, quality, quality
    assurance person or three m co ordinator. There are many jobs that you can do
    at that level. Make sure that you either do one job really well. Eso you really
    appeal for a long time or you have lots of experience doing all the other jobs
    eso they that you have a broad range of what they do. So what you don't want to
    do is, uh, keep doing the second class job that you were doing before, and there's
    a lot of opportunity for that. You might become promoted, and they're not going
    to switch you overnight. So if you wanna be promoted, um, faster to the next level,
    just say, Hey, you know what? I was a second class. I was a technical person.
    I was going down there in the in the in the turbine generators and opening up
    cleaning things, and they allow you to do that. But they really look highly on
    the people who stop doing that. Figure out what the first classes are supposed
    to be doing. Um, if they're gonna be leading the whole entire unit of, like, let's
    say 15 people and start doing it immediately, Um, start seeing what the chief
    does and saying, and you have to say, Hey, you know what? Is there something that
    I could do to help you out with that? Yeah, sure. Take these papers or Yeah, sure.
    This is the qualification, Um, of this unit. Make sure that they're all at, you
    know, 90% or greater a songs. You start taking on the role of the next level above
    you, or at least like being very, very proficient at the job that you're supposed
    to be. Um, then you can start doing those things earlier rather than later.

  transcript: the most important things on a resume. Our the things you put down for
    your experience, we want to be really concise. We want you to say that you worked
    at this unit or this shop on this ship and maybe like two or three, um, lines
    about, like a concisely what you did. Um, And the longer that is, the better it
    is. So one thing I have to say is, um let's say for me I was on, uh, the USS John
    C. Stennis and I was on there actually longer than I should have been. I did a
    six year tour. So for my block, it's gonna say USS John C. Stennis for six years.
    And of course, I did multiple things on there. Um, I was three and coordinator.
    I was, uh, lpo of of another unit. I was I covered all of the watches, but in
    the end, it's just ah, paragraph. You know, maybe a long paragraph. But it's just
    11 in general, so it's better to have multiple ships. Um, the more things that
    you can do them or training that you can do if you could get a C school in there.
    That's going to be another block. If you can stand a watch for another unit, that's
    gonna be another block. If you can qualify, uh, something that's out of your rate
    rather than become propulsion Electrician's let's say for like three years, um,
    split it up, say, Propulsion Electrician's for a year and a half and then, hey,
    you know what? Like let me try to qualify what works in a supervisor instead,
    and that's gonna be another block. So you're talking about quantity over the quality
    of the job because the quality in the Navy, they expect you to be proficient,
    vastly proficient at your job. So the longer you do it, it doesn't count. You
    have to, like, take something and then keep moving.

  transcript: If you're looking for a new role to help you advance, you have to make
    sure number one that it's in your field. You could do tons of jobs around this
    ship, but if it's not in your field, then it's not gonna quite help you so much.
    So I think the main source is probably gonna be your chief. Uh, he's gonna tell
    you, or she will tell you, um, the rules that are available. And sometimes there
    are things that you don't even no pertain to your rate. One for me was three.
    M coordinator. I didn't realize that that was a job that a new could take on,
    but it's a high, high, high position job. Another one that was hidden from me
    that was going on behind the scenes was, uh, the Tech Pub Library, the Technical
    Publications library. And you have to be really on familiar with all of the books
    that are associated with the nuclear field. And you have to know, like where they're
    supposed to be located. Um, and you also help out when people are doing research.
    They say, Hey, you know what? Like there's this schematic that I need you should
    be able toe, you know, find which book it's in and do some of the basic research
    for him for that. And that's another thing that can promote you. So, um, your
    chief and other supervisors in your chain of command can actually, like, point
    you out to some of these jobs that can kind of, like might be something different
    than what you're used to but might be hidden from you or might be useful in ways
    that you didn't know about before.

  transcript: the ones you mainly want to focus on when you're talking about, like
    a choice that can really, um, disperse you out to many different places is number
    one, your family. If you have ah, wife or husband back home, um, it's gonna really
    uplift their career. You have to make sure that the thing that you're trying to
    do doesn't conflict with their own personal job. Um, with your kids, uh, they
    tend to be a little bit more flexible, but make sure that you're not disrupting
    their life too much. You know, they have a career that they're trying thio to
    make for themselves, you know, as far as like, their school and their grades.
    Maybe they don't wanna, like, go to another school just yet. Ah, lot of people.
    And you might think that that's trivial. But I found especially in Japan Ah, lot
    of people, like, stay at a certain place or extend their careers even longer based
    on their kids finishing school at a specific high school. Um and yeah. So make
    sure you put your family number one, uh number two. You want thio? Talk to people
    in the in your chain of command who might have experience with the place that
    you're going. One place I was considering going was, um, going to be thio the
    ship a submarine tender in Italy. Now I was told that it was gonna be in Guam,
    and I was prepared toe like, go to that place. But they actually, like, changed
    their spot and they were in Italy at the time, or it might have been vice versa.
    And so you think that you might be going toe certain ship, but in reality, you
    don't know what's actually happening. You don't know the mission of that ship.
    You don't know the type of job that you're doing on that ship. So the more information
    that you get from online from other people who have been on the ships from your
    supervisors, the better and more informed. Um um, answer that you could give yourself

    a list of books that are required reading for your promotion. When you take the
    test, they take out little snippets of it or chapters from it. And then, um, they
    transcribe those into questions on I think they're like 200 questions or something
    that's supposed to fill out before that, I just thought, Well, you know, like

    I went upto Washington, and, you know, it wasn't a choice of, uh, ships we were
    actually like I moved there because of a ship swap. But, um, yeah, there's no
    choice with that. And then and then I got out. Um, but two years before I actually
    got out of the service at my six year point, you're supposed to actually do short
    command, and I've never experienced a short command before. I had only been on
    a ship at that time and, um, the recruiter actually said, Hey, you know what?
    Like we have some opportunities for you, you could become an instructor in New
    York or he actually gave me the opportunity to go to ah submarine tender in Italy
    slash Guam. And I didn't do either one of those. And he was kind of pushing forward
    the benefits of both. You know, if I was an instructor, that would have, you know,

    wider range of things that they can do. You can still do the same rate that you
    are that you're in. There are many nukes that continue to be nukes afterwards.
    But if you're an officer, yeah, you have the chance toe, um goto many more places
    to be in a higher responsibility profession, I think eso you you consider? Um,
    Officer, if you were, if you had a degree during the time now, you could be like
    me, which is use the profession of the naval profession as a way to get your education.
    And in that case, I would say you go to school after you get out. Now, um, for
    me, I stayed in the Navy Reserve, and that really worked really, really good with
    with going to school. Um, I did my six years active. I took a few classes online.
    Um, I think I had, like, three or four classes that that I was attempting, at
    least. And then at the end of eight years, um, after joining the Navy Reserve,
    I I was in school for full time, basically for the I guess the last, like, eight
    years or so. I did my undergrad and I did a master's. And I'm currently, um, still
    in the Navy Reserve and still getting my masters. And I think that freedom that
    you have without worrying about full time work, uh, is really beneficial, Especially
    if you want to do really good at your at your at your, um, class in your classes

  transcript: the range of opportunities that you have, like, uh, they can come in
    the form of actual work that you do on the ship. So there are many jobs that you
    can do. You can become works in a supervisor. You could become low dispatcher
    for electrician's anyways, Proportion Electrician's. You can have all those normal
    watch stations, but you can also extend yourself throughout. The ship is, Well,
    um, you could become, Let's say, um, surface where or fair qualifier. Which means
    that you know exactly how the surface ship works for the engineering department,
    and you can train other people like, for instance, cooks and boatswain's mates.
    You know how your service works. Uh, that's another thing you can put on your
    on your resume. Soto be able to do that to be able to train other people like
    that. That's, uh, one way that you can expand your career. You can also go to
    school. Um, everyone goes to a school, at least for uh, if they're a nuke. But
    there are other schools, like a C school, and there's a long list of schools that
    you could get from the Web that that you can go to you could go toe school as
    long as there is a freedom in your department. You could go to school every other
    year if you wanted Thio. Um, once you get out, then obviously, you know, you can
    use your Montgomery job Little benefits. Or I guess it's post 9 11. Now that you
    can, you know, go toe, go to school and take educational classes. You can also
    do that if you're an active duty member as well. I did that as well. I think I
    took two classes. Calculus, um, and in English. But I must admit, it is a little
    bit harder with, ah, full time work.

    that I look up to. The main one that I have is, let's say, the Devo, um uh, the
    devil could actually be a young person, maybe just two years in, but they've given
    been, given the responsibility to look after the unit, and they've proven that
    they can. They've been given the commission, and for the most part, like like
    they take it on full charge. And they have a lot of interesting things that they
    could tell you toe s O that you could grow as a person as well. Um, a little bit
    above that is the Chang the chief engineer? Um, that's for normal surface ships.
    I just came back where we had an awesome chang. Who? I think she was a mechanic,
    but she had a, ah, large understanding of the way the entire plant worked. And
    I got a lot of information from her on a aircraft care. You have the reactor officer
    whom I didn't experience s o much, but I still look to them as a leader because
    you could not tell that they were not the captain of the ship the way they move,
    the way that they talked the way that they carried themselves. Um, everything
    that they did was very, very disciplined and organized. And you knew that nothing
    on that ship would be wrong if they were in charge. That's the way that they carried
    themselves. Um above them is the CNO and then the president. I like to them a
    lot less. Obviously, you know, they have the whole entire, um, service to run.
    However, they are our commanders and chiefs. So whatever they're doing, you have
    to make sure that they're leading by example. Um, you filtered that down to the
    troops. So if they're saying, hey, you know what? We have to go to this area and
    these are the reasons, you know, you have to take that on, and you have to, like,
    present that presidential atmosphere to the rest of the unit. Um, of course, it
    could be a little bit political when you're talking about you know, the president
    less political when you're talking about the CNO. You know this, you know, has
    mainly one idea for everyone and depending on in for the president, depend on
    whether it's a Democrat or Republican or some other party like, um, it might be
    hard Thio get completely behind all of their words. But, um, those are the things
    that you focus on. You focus on the mission, the mission of the ship, the mission
    of your aircraft here, and yeah, you should. And I think most military people
    do have the impression that he is our leader. And he's the example that, um, that
    we're following. So yeah, from the president all the way down, toe the chief right
    beside me. You look toe everybody around you, all your leadership, Um, for that
    for that experience.

    known Maura about before I joined the, uh, field that I went in. I'm happy with
    being electrician's, but I did think coming in that you did have more opportunity
    to do different things. I thought maybe one day I could be in Germany doing X
    and another time being in the bottom of Africa. Doing why, um, as an electrician's,
    you know, I thought, Okay, well, sure, I'll be, um, taking voltage on these pumps.
    But I thought it could, You know, every place has electrician's, uh jobs associated
    with it, so I thought I could be associated with any of them. But that's actually
    not true. Um, for me, we have the submarines that we could go to and the aircraft
    carriers that we could go to, and those are the main places. You have a little
    bit more freedom when you're talking about the short commands that you could go
    to, um, because we don't just want you always focus on these three ships all the
    time, so it's kind of like it's not a vacation, but it's more like a different

    But those short commands are few and far between hope for the majority of your
    work, you're expected to kind of, like fall within the field. If you're an officer,

    eight years that I had and there's so many things that that go into it. There's
    the schooling that I had there the you know, grad level, um, classes that I took

  transcript: you can tell if someone's going to be a good mentor by how much you
    see them interacting with other people, whether they're a good listener and whether
    their hands on. For the most part, I found that chiefs are really good about that
    When I'm down in the plant. If I'm, let's have a new guy, their third class, you
    know, working with another person, you know, trying to, you know, fix, fix, fix
    the breaker. If I look to my right, you know, see in the next room that there's
    a chief down there with his flashlight, um, talking and explaining has the procedure
    out saying, You know, pointing with his finger touch that do that. It's not like
    this. He puts the he puts the book down and he goes down there and he starts the
    process. Then he puts the picks the book back up and has the other person continue.
    The people that interact like that, those are the best mentors. So you try to
    find someone who's going to be very interactive, not just listening, but also,
    you know, like, um down there in physical person with doing the maintenance, then
    you know that they're going to be good to go

  transcript: I'll be honest right now. I don't exactly know. Um, the final destination,
    my life is headed, but I do have some paths. Maybe it's gonna be making my own
    business. Um, the business could be creating something. I'm a computer scientist,
    so maybe I could create an application. Um, maybe I could develop some type of
    school. Um, for instance, I'm studying cybersecurity right now. Maybe I could
    develop my own subjects security, business and just grow it. Who knows? I'm also
    trying to get into the federal government. So maybe I could scrap those personal
    business plans and just be the best federal person, federal government person.
    That could be. Now there's some places I could go. Let's say there's NASA. I could
    be, um, someone in charge of putting spaceships on Mars. And that would be a non
    honorable goal. Toby, apart off. Um, I could work for the Institute of Creative
    Technologies, which is the company the company that I'm working at right now that
    they make virtual virtual environments for education and training. That's something
    that I've always been interested in. Um, out of all of these goals, I think the
    most important thing is to focus on what's present. Um, what I'm presently doing.
    And that's just trying to be the best student that I could be at the Naval Postgraduate
    School, um, my subject to cyber security. So I have my goals in front of me. I
    take four classes, make sure that I do things now that I haven't done in the past,
    which means read the book from front to cover, whether it's requested or not,
    which means asking questions to the instructor's, which means which I hadn't done
    before. Which means conversing with my other peers, which, instead of like being
    so individual, I need to really, you know, get out there and see See how people
    solve these problems that are really difficult. So as long as like, for the next
    two years, um, I'm doing those jobs, though that work that it takes to be a really
    good student in one of those jobs. It doesn't matter which one a za long as it's
    challenging to me, um is gonna come into play, and hopefully I'll be successful
    with it at that time

    there to pass that you can go either. You separate completely. Um, yes, but let's
    say you do four years. You still have four more years to do your entire service.
    But those last four years, a kind of invisible. They just want you to be around
    in case there's a war or something like that. But for the most part, if you finish
    your active duty tour, uh, you still have a role to play in the Navy because you'll
    always be a veteran until the day that you die. So you take that on, you have
    to make sure that you always, um, upstanding. You don't wanna be involved in crime.
    You don't wanna be, uh, you don't wanna do anything that's gonna cause disgrace
    on the Navy, because you could be like 73 years old. If you do something wrong,
    guess what's going to be on that report. They're going to say he was a prior military
    servicemen or she was a prior military servicemen. And you don't want to cause
    that disgrace. So, um, you get out and just make sure that you maintain that military
    bearing from that point on, Otherwise you could be like me. I'm in the Navy reserves
    and I still continue that Navy tradition just in a minimized capacity. I still
    go on. I still put things uniform. I still, um, serve on some kind of ship or
    some kind of shipyard every year, um, in a fully naval capacity. But otherwise
    I just take advantage of my educational benefits, and I still make sure that I'm
    always have that military mindset with everything that I do.

    do with it for the Navy. You don't need anything if you're trying to join the
    enlisted ranks. I didn't even have any idea about what electricity was basically
    on. My and I did just fine. Um, you can think of it just like preparation. The
    better you do at your degree, whether it's just a sheet of paper or you're really
    good student or you're like the most outstanding student, you know, those are
    all just preparation. Um, and just because it's preparation, um, you just realize
    you're going to get that preparation no matter what, just by being in the service.
    So even if you don't have the degree, you could just simply replace that with
    time and in, you know, like after two years or three years, you could basically
    have just as much knowledge as somebody with a degree. Eso yeah, it could give
    you a boost ahead in life, whether it's, ah, where you're working for the Navy
    or civilian job. But don't depend on your your degree. It's ah, it's It could
    give you some kind of opportunity to learn things that you wouldn't have learned

    It's gonna be anonymous, so you can feel free to say whatever you want to without
    thoughts of repercussion later on. You can also go toe most medical facilities,

    ah few tools at your disposal. Uh, number one is kind of ignoring the problem,
    right? And that's probably one of the worst things that you can do. But, um uh,
    if you try to distract them from the problem, then it works. For some people,
    um, it depends on what it is they're grieving over eso. If you keep their mind
    on their work without delving too much on what it is that they're grieving about,
    that could help. Um, what's ah, better tactic is to get it out in the open and
    see if they need to be taking off the ship or assigned to a different job. That,
    like, let's say, this job is kind of dangerous. If they keep performing it, um,
    you could send them toe something that's like, let's say, going to the library
    and helping people there. There they have a little bit more timeto think about,
    um, the thing that's causing them trouble without putting other people's lives
    in jeopardy. Um, uh, one of the last result resource is, is toe. Get them off
    the ship. Um, if for some reason like just being on the ship is something that
    they can't really um, perform effectively at, then maybe they should get off the
    ship. Either you give them some vacation time, and you just let them, um, grieve
    with whatever resource is they need, Uh, maybe with family, maybe with the psychologist,
    Uh, maybe with their personal chaplain, Um, you can send them there, or you can,
    um, send them to a specific place. Like, for instance, um, there are several places
    on the base that they could go to, um, if they need help. Especially like, let's

    type of person are they? Are they sweet and kind? Are they angry? And it's important
    to notice changes. So if there's a risk of suicide, then, um, I take all of that
    into consideration and make sure that I get them to the experts. Uh, this could
    be whether, um, they're more violent than usual, whether they're punching things
    where they're hurting, whether they're hurting other people. Um, whether something
    happens in their life. Whether, like, for instance, their wife just, um walked
    out of the house or the kids are having problems at school or they were having
    an argument with the next door neighbor. You know, those are things that, if you
    hear about you, should take those into consideration and be it something really

  transcript: there are local rules that inform you, um, how you can date? What's
    general is that you can't fat in eyes, which means that if you're in a supervisory
    position, you can't, um, date someone underneath you. So there are exceptions.
    So, for instance, let's say your first class can you date second classes. Well,
    it might depend on whether that second classes, um, on a different, um, like like
    a part of a different um, unit. Then you can tow Electrician's date. Well, if
    ah, first classes in, uh, reactor room one and the second classes in reactor room
    to even though they're a part of the same electrical division, maybe they can
    date. So, um, that that that's a little bit more flexible. Um, what's not flexible
    is, for instance, if you're a chief, you can't really date people underneath you,
    so they actually have to get off the off the ship. Um, if you're an officer, you
    also can't date, um, enlisted people. Um, maybe officers can date each other,
    but for instance, they have to be separate. Basically, the rule is, um, within
    the chain of command. Nobody can, uh, anyone up the chain of command or below
    the chain of command. You have to actually have to be separate or you have to
    be off the ship.

    you're not supposed to know about it, because if there is a sexual assault, um,
    commanding officers is maybe he could know about it, but he doesn't have any names.
    But in general, people kind of know, um, who is getting too close to other people?
    And that's when rumors start. In those cases, the person who's making the the

  transcript: sexual assault is really different than other bad behaviors in the fact
    that you can actually, like, lose valuable team members based on it. Um, number
    one sexual assault generally doesn't have, um, specifically to do with work. Of
    course, they can occur, um, during the work environment, and that creates bad
    moral, um, bad morale within the unit. However, um, whether I can, you know, check
    a pump, you know, for for the correct voltage or not, has nothing to do with,
    um, me trying to get a date with you later on. So So there's a very, very strong
    line between work and, um dating, but they mix when you involve sexual assault
    and sexual harassment. Um, specifically, I remember we had a master chief, and
    he was one of the good master chiefs that I've had. Um, he was very direct. He's
    very stern. He got everybody to do the work the right way and efficiently. Um,
    however, he had, um, some communication with, uh, someone someone in our unit.
    Eventually. Hey. Got kicked out of the off the ship, and, um, he eventually became
    a senior chief, and we saw him walking around his career. You know, like it's
    probably gonna end pretty soon after that ast faras the grill like she stayed
    on, but she had a badge, and yeah, everyone knew what happened between them. Um,
    she got to stay on because, like, she's lower. Um, she had a lower responsibility
    in that, um the higher you go, the more supervisor you are, the more you're gonna
    be hammered down on, you know, And a zoo was hit, as was her case. I'm not sure
    that she had a, um her rank removed, but yeah, yeah, that that's, ah, fragmentation
    in in that case, And it really affects the unit to have someone who's really good
    at their job being removed and having someone who stays in the unit have that
    cast that shadow above her for the rest of time that she's there. So sexual assault,
    sexual harassment, fraternization, all the sexual things that don't really deal
    with your job. You kinda want to stay away from, um, leave playtime and playtime
    and and work at work.

    Yellow is somewhere in the middle and green, I think, happens fairly often. And
    the reason for, uh, slight sexual comments throughout the work days Because, especially
    on deployment, you know, you're with everyone all the time. Um, from sunup to
    sundown. Um, you have guys and girls and they have their emotions. They have their
    feelings. And some people, actually, I think the military isn't is a wonderful
    place toe. Meet a spouse. There are many military couples. And without, like,
    talking to each other during work house, are you gonna get to know the other person?
    It's when you ah kind of go too far in trying to show your emotion to the other
    person. I'm allowed toe talk to anyone on this ship and say, Hey, you know what
    I think that's Ah, nice outfit that you have. And that's one way that you can
    start. Ah, communication. Um, once we get out of work, for instance. I see them
    outside. I could maybe get their number at work, and then we take it further outside
    of work. Um, if you're on deployment, you don't have that opportunity. Uh, everything
    that you do, you know, if you're gonna talk to them, it's going to be at work
    because you're at work for 24 hours per day. Uh, the most important part of the
    most important thing to remember is that it cannot exist on this ship. There is
    no dating. There is no getting together. There's no kissing and hugging on this
    ship at all. Um, so, yeah, you can get to know people. You can sit down, chat,
    talk, talk about the general quarters that happen, talk about like when we get
    off the ship, you know, like like let's continue this further. But on the ship,
    you know, just make sure that it's purely platonic and and that that will save
    you a lot of heartache in the future.

    as a chief, when I'm giving counseling, I always try toe have the door open, because
    when you have, uh, a person that that that could happen with and you have the
    door shut, then you know words gonna happen. Um, especially like, if if the two
    of you don't really, um, connect so much, then you know, like false accusations
    can fly. So those air scenarios that you tryto have other people around so that
    they can kind of diffuse the situation or at least like make sure that, um, words
    aren't sad and touching aren't going on. Um, and it zips in the wide open area
    outside of work. The obvious places are bars and clubs, you know, even though
    it's ah very public setting because you don't feel as much, um, stress due to
    the job, um, like people are actually looking at at you, you know, like thinking
    about sexual assault. You let down your guard and you get a little bit more touchy,

    say we have a sailor who just got a red badge or yellow badge. You know, they
    got caught drinking. They got caught staying out after curfew. And the Navy has
    these rules like, Hey, you know what? Like now, you're not supposed to be out
    after 11 o'clock. In those cases, I'm a little bit mawr, um, more strict with
    them. I say, Hey, you know what? Like if you get caught past caught, if you get
    caught out past 11 o'clock in, the name is going to do this. So I suggest I strong
    suggest that you make it here by 10 o'clock. Eso That's like a personal thing
    that I do because I don't want them to ruin their career. You know, like if you're
    really strict on the line and you know, even even if you're over like past two
    minutes, you know there's no there's no remorse for those guys, you know, and
    I know that those rules could be, like, really strict like that. You know, you
    could be, uh, going to jail for bread and water with bread and water. You know,
    I I don't wanna see anyone in those situations. So I give them a buffer to help
    them with their careers. So that, like, if they do go past my band, um, I don't
    have toe follow the Navy's rules. Whereas if they go back past the Navy's band,
    then I would definitely go pack, go through with the Navy's rules, you know? So
    I give him buffers, personal buffers.

    a chair and the third person is there, and, um, they know exactly what you said.
    Um, they know what they need to change. Another type of counseling is a written
    counseling. You know, you put in the record, you say, Hey, you know what? Like
    now something's gonna happen if you do this, then I have it written down that
    these things are gonna change. Um, so yeah, just as the supervisor, make sure

  transcript: in the Navy, we tend to have three distinct groupings of sexual assault.
    Sexual harassment, Um, for the green light that tend, those tend to be like a
    words that you can say to another person. Um, hey, sexy. Hey, sweetie. Things
    that are a little bit above friendliness, um, that the other person might feel
    uncomfortable with, or maybe even another person a third person might feel uncomfortable
    with those could be green light. That's when a supervisor goes to the, um to the
    parties and kind of squashes it either the offending party and say, Hey, you know
    what? You shouldn't say those words. Or you could go to the person who was spoken
    to and say, Hey, um, this'd what I noticed. Um, are are you comfortable with that?
    And kind of, uh, like, ease the situation there just through words. Yellow light
    can be a little bit more, um, more intense. That could be slight touching, maybe
    grabbing the shoulders and and rubbing or, um, patting people on the but especially
    between, like after sporting events, you know those type of Pat's, um, when there
    is touching involved, you have to make sure that like the person who was touched
    doesn't feel that that action was sexual. However, it can be classified sexual,
    um, based on another person's viewpoint or even if you noticed it yourself. You
    know, like if you were offended by it, or you have some questions concerning it
    thin that could be yellow, regardless of whether either of the two parties thought
    it was sexual or not. Um, but yeah, touching and especially words like, you know,
    like more serious words Like, uh, I want to do this to the to you Or I think,
    uh, you know, we should go to this place, you know, like it's a It could be pretty
    pretty bad. That's in that sense. Red light is definite touching. Um, maybe on
    private sections, um, lower lower extremities, uh, maybe grabbing long grabs,
    maybe constant stairs, a certain a certain place, which obviously has sexual overtones
    on those for those cases. You definitely have to bring those up to a supervisor
    and get it documented.

    as a chief. But you start sending people tow opposite, um, workstations. So whereas
    before you can send anybody with anyone, um, you to just choose two names, you
    go up there. Um, fix this machine or YouTube. Go, go, go check the voltage. Uh,
    you you have to know who your people are and how they interact with each other,
    and you don't wanna push some buttons. Maybe it might take a few weeks to kind
    of like, um uh, decrease the intensity in the in the unit. So in that case, you
    know, for temporarily you separate people, um, that might work with with sexual
    assault. Um, however, when you're dealing with sexual assault, things can happen
    anywhere you know, especially with with a small unit. So in that case, you might
    want toe have other people aware of the tension between two people, so that, like
    whenever there's a new opportunity for the two of them, to be alone that as a
    as a group, as a team, you kind of like, make sure everybody is on the up and
    up. Um, for instance, like people could be sitting with each other at, um when
    they're eating lunch together. And that's ah, really prime opportunity for, um,
    words to be said, um, threats to be made right If people kind of know the other
    people in the unit. Um, so even as a supervisor, if you're not there, they can
    still kind of quell the situation. Um, it might get to a point, uh, that you have
    to send the person to another unit if if they can't interact with each other.
    Well, um, if it escalates too much, then you might want toe talk to the VA or

    um, I tell them exactly what I expect for them. Toe earn the wars that they're
    gonna get. Earn the marks that they're gonna get. Um, I make sure during the midterm
    counseling, I sit them down. I give them a sheet of paper that describes how generally,
    um, grade them. Um, maybe not always with the direct marks, but I tell them where
    their strengths are, where their weaknesses are and what I expect them to do.
    Um, in the next six months, to kind of increase their scores. Um, and especially
    during counseling, I, um, make sure that I put everyone's, um I put everybody
    on on an Excel sheet, and I have, like, all of the roles, like professional development
    leadership, um, can, uh, climate inequality. I put all of those down, and then
    I mark exactly based on what they wrote on the back of their evaluation, how they
    increased each of those scores and I go through everyone. I make sure that, like
    if I gave somebody a good score, that someone who did the same exact thing gets
    that same score, a zealous for the negatives. And then, um, I think that that's
    how I prevent bias in my own grading That goes the same for awards if I'm handing
    out awards or if I'm giving promotions.

    let's say your, um, grading people from being for being a second class and below,
    or even a third class and below. Um, you're not graded on those types of leadership
    responsibilities talking to 5, 10 people. So the quiet people need to have just
    as much of a voice and, um, need to be graded just as well as someone who is very,
    very vocal if they're doing the same quality work. Eso chat with the people who
    aren't very spoken. Um, actually, you want to praise and criticized the work,
    um, at the right locations as well. Um, for instance, there's a quiet person you
    might wanna mention everyone. Hey, I really respect um, Semen Johnson over here
    for doing this job. Maybe they might not say anything during that time, But everyone
    else knows, Like, Hey, you know what? Like that's how I can, um, make my work
    better. Um, And then privately, obviously, if they do something wrong, um, no
    matter what their behavior is, you wanna talk to them one on one personal person
    to make sure that they understand their faults and the flaws.

  transcript: Well, my name is M C. Clint Anderson. Ian stands for electrician's mate.
    I've been the Navy for about 20 years in the Navy Reserve right now. Um, for the
    first six years of my naval career, I've been on lots of different tours. Aircraft
    care, USS John C. Stennis, start off with a nuclear power school. So, um, the
    first tour that I had was working in the nuclear engine room in the propulsion
    plants, fixing electrical lights, um, working with other people, trying toe repair
    pumps, repair valves, um, moving the throttles on this ship toe provide propulsion.
    I had a lot experience with that. Um, there's a lot of clean that went on, but
    for the most part, it was satisfactory tour that I spent in South Carolina in
    New York. Um, um, the most recent place was Washington. And after that, that initial
    six year tour actually extended for two more years to have a total of eight years,
    two years of school, six years on the ship, and then I actually got out. I didn't
    want to get out of the Navy. Um, completely actually started joining the Naval
    Reserve. And I've been in the Navy Reserve. Um, for the last 10 years, for that
    whole 10 years, I've actually been in school, working on and off. But for the
    most part, I, um I got to see a lot more of the world through the Navy reserves
    than I did ever on the ship. They take me toe all the all the different states.
    Washington, Hawaii, New York again. Norfolk, Virginia, San Diego. Um, yeah. Every
    single year, actually. Do something with the Navy for about this summer. We go
    and we we go to a shipyard and we repair some things or they give us some kind
    of training. Um, outside of the navy, I've been in school, I've been in, um, I've
    been going to USC, and I got my masters there for computer science. Before that,
    I was an undergrad at UC Berkeley, and currently I'm at the Naval Postgraduate
    School in Monterey, California. So for the last 20 years, I've had a a wide range
    of experiences from, you know, touring overseas. Um, the first time I joined the
    Navy was right after, um, 9 11 happened, So I was really involved with wars, and
    I got to see a lot of things that most people would never see. So I'd say that
    the Navy has been been pretty good, and I'm looking forward to my next tour.
