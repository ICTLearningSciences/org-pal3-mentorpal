  transcript: one of the things I love about my job is that there really aren't average
    days. Um, there are average, maybe weeks, I would say, but every day is different.
    So on the days that I'm teaching, I usually teach classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
    And so on those days, most of my day is spent in teaching activities. So I'm either
    actually lecturing in a class or I'm holding office hours where I'm meeting with
    students or I'm working on lecture prep, you know, getting things ready for the
    next week. Usually, uh, grading falls into that, too. Um, so that's Tuesdays and
    Thursdays and then on the other days, Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Those are
    usually devoted mostly to my research. So Monday is the day that I try to reserve
    to do a lot of writing. Um, and then on Wednesdays, I'm kind of focusing more
    on, um, actually doing the research. Um, and then Fridays I have lab meetings,
    and I meet with, uh, my personal lab. Also meet with the with the fibromyalgia
    research group lab that that I work with Andi, then sprinkled also in those Mondays,
    Wednesdays and Fridays. Our committee meetings, um those air, you know, happening
    all the time. Um eso really? When I look at my calendar, there's some kind of
    overall patterns, But honestly, every single day is unique. It's it's all a little
    different. And that's one of the things I really love about. My job is it never
    gets boring. I can honestly say that my job is never boring. Sometimes it's overwhelming.
    Um, sometimes it's annoying, but it is never, ever, ever boring.

  transcript: what it's sometimes hard to estimate how many hours I work, like either
    per day or per week. Um, I kind of live by the academic calendar. And so it's
    a It's a larger time scale, really. Andi, their their periods within that timescale,
    where there's just a ton of work to be done and there just aren't enough hours
    in the day. And then there are other times where it's a little more quiet essence
    on dares not, you know, as much to be done, and it's a little bit easier. Eso
    You know, for instance, at the very beginning of the semester, when I'm getting
    sure they're making sure that all my classes air ready to go everything on our
    you know, the online course sites air together and where they need to be, the
    lectures, air all prepared. The assignments are all kind of like ready to get
    going. Um, that's a that's huge. That's a lot of work. And it's just, you know,
    long days, Andi. Also, at the very end of the semester, we're in finals and, you
    know, just doing a ton of grading, wrapping up the semester, getting everything
    kind of filed and put away and put to bed. Um and actually also kind of like laying
    the groundwork for the coming semester. That's also very, very, very busy. Time
    on Ben within this semester itself. They're different times like it just sometimes
    it depends on the rhythm of the class. So, you know, I in all of my classes, I
    have students writing papers. So when I get a stack of 40 papers, that's gonna
    be ah, long week. So that's gonna be a week where there's just a ton of grading
    and every spare moment that I have. I'm just grading all the time. Um, if I don't
    have a paper due that week and any of my classes, it's probably gonna be a lighter,
    weak, And I'm not gonna have a much on Ben waken layer on top of that. The research
    that happens So sometimes if we're in kind of, ah, data collection mode, that's
    just, you know, kind of trickling in as we, you know, meet with people or do things
    like that. Once we have the data, then we go in tow, analyzing mode and writing
    up mode. And those were much more intense modes. And there's just lots more hours,
    and they're happening really fast. So, you know, with all of these different algorithms
    kind of layering on top of each other, it's really, really hard toe estimate.
    How many hours a week I work? Um, you know, I really don't have a good feel for
    it. Sometimes I think like a lawyer, like I should everything even when I'm in
    the shower. And I'm thinking about like, what am I going to do with this research
    program that I should be? You know, counting that is work. But, you know, I don't
    do that. The point is just to get it done. So whatever it takes to get it done,
    do it. Some days are easier than others and thoughts about it.

    work during the summer. That's my favorite. You have the summers off. No, no,
    I do not. Um, and that the biggest one, I think, actually is that teaching, lecturing,
    standing in front of the class and talking that that is essentially the biggest
    part of my job. And that's what I dio. And so the idea is that if I'm not actively
    lecturing, then I'm not working. And so, you know, I mean, if you look at my schedule
    so I teach three classes a semester and each of those classes has about two, 24
    hours of lecture every week. So really, I mean, I'm lecturing for 10 hours a week.
    Maybe it's actually a very small part of my job, but a lot of people kind of think
    that that's all of my job on. But I don't think that there's kind of the realization
    that for every hour that I'm lecturing, there's a whole bunch of prep, and then
    there's a whole bunch of stuff that has to happen after that. So the lecture part
    is just this little, teeny tiny sliver of what I'm doing. Really. The bulk of
    the work is on either side of that, and that's just for teaching. I mean, then
    I have the whole research component and that, you know, most people don't see
    that at all. Eso that maybe is another misconception that people have. Is that
    really all I do is teach and actually the teaching the the giving the lecture
    is such a small, tiny part of what I dio.

    I thought that I was going thio pursue a career in the pharmaceutical industry
    and be working, you know, in mostly in a lab. Either you know, running a lab or
    something like that. Um, in terms of my career, as as a professor, um, I think
    that now, as opposed to like when I started being a professor, um, I think that
    one of the things that's different it may be kind of unexpected is how how much
    freedom I'm I have much more trust in my students. That's that's, I think, a good
    way to say it. I when I started out, I was I think I was very hands on and very
    kind of micro managing and controlling when it came. Thio my students, particularly
    those students in my research lab. Um I think now that I've been doing this for
    longer, um, I am I have learned that they need to have a certain amount of freedom
    for their wonderful ideas to blossom, and so and and and kind of, just seeding
    that control is a part of that process. Um eso kind of instead of saying, Here's
    what we're gonna dio saying we'll hear some parameters here. Here's what we could
    dio here some of the possibilities that I thought of. What do you think we should
    dio and and letting them come up with ideas? Andi, I think that that's been a
    change for me across the course of my of my career is a professor is kind of stepping
    back a little bit more and ceding control, um, to my students.

    miss interacting with my students. It's been very difficult to not have that interaction
    with them, and it's made me realizing myself that interaction with my students
    is a huge motivation. It's a huge motivator for me on DSO when I don't have that,
    it's kind of like What's the point? Why am I doing this? Not entirely that bad,

    have those interactions with my students. Um, it's also required me. Thio use

    that's that's a little concerning. But, you know, we're all in the same boat,

    with various issues and we just have to do the best we can. But, yeah, it's definitely

  transcript: so I don't think most people go into academics to be rich. And if they
    do, they're probably not very smart. Um, teachers on at all levels are notoriously
    underpaid. Um, and I think that that's probably true, You know, for me, I You
    know, I definitely feel like I work very hard, Um, relative to the compensation
    that I receive. Andi, I think that if I was just in it for the money, I probably
    would have quit long ago because the compensation is just not there. Um, in terms
    of being able toe live on my salary, I think that depends on a lot of things.
    I mean, number one, I live in Southern California, which is one of the most expensive
    places to live. And so, you know, given my salary Yeah, I mean, it would it would
    be really tight. My husband, I'm married and my husband also works. And so we're
    a dual income family, and that allows us thio afford the life that we have. Um,
    if he lost his job and we lost his income, um, I think we could make it, but I
    think that our lives would be very much different than they are right now. Um,
    on the other hand, I have a friend who is also a professor and works at a State
    University. But she's in North Carolina and she makes the same amount that I dio.
    But she essentially has more money than I dio because her dollars go much farther
    because she's in North Carolina. Eso if you look a, you know, housing prices.
    If you look even that things just like groceries. Like, what's the cost of milk
    and what's the cost of gas? Um, it's much lower in other parts of the country.
    And so in Southern California in particular, you know, we're just we have a very
    high cost of living. And so every dollar doesn't go a Sfar. Um now that also,
    you know, what do you mean by making it? Well, I mean, that also depends on the
    lifestyle that you wanna lead. Um, my husband and I and our Children, we really
    enjoy traveling, And so we try thio travel a much as we possibly can, and we've
    gone to a lot of really great places of the family. We've gone to Scotland and
    we've gone to Bali and we've gone to Brazil, um, to name a few places. But we
    afford that by cutting back in other places. So, you know, we live actually pretty
    simply, um and and we use the money that we save from living simply thio put towards,
    you know, other things like travel adventures, eso it's, you know, it's kind of
    hard Thio say you know how much a given salary is gonna afford because it really
    just depends on the kind of life that you wanna live. If I wanted toe, you know,
    drive a really awesome fancy car and eat out all the time and wear designer clothes
    and travel and, you know, by a lot of stuff, then no, my salary would not allow
    for that. But for the life that I do live, um, you know, I would say that my salary
    is pretty good. I mean, I don't know about supporting, like, the whole family
    on this salary. Um, although again, you know, my husband and I have talked about
    it, and if his income was to just evaporate, which is possible because he works
    in the private sector, um, you know, it would be different and there would be
    things that we would definitely have to cut, but I think we could get by on my
    salary

  transcript: the salary for a professor can can Very, pretty widely. Um, it's usually
    I would say probably between how I'm bad at this, and it changes I should mention
    with inflation. Eso You know, I've been in my position for almost 20 years now.
    And so the salaries that people were hired at when at the time when I was hired
    were much lower than the salaries at which incoming new professors are being hired
    at now. And And every, um, every raise that we get, we essentially get to raises
    throughout the course of our careers. So you get hired and you work for, I think,
    five years, six years, something like that. And then you go up for, ah, promotion
    from associate or sorry, Assistant professor to associate professor. And that
    is when also for us, you get tenure, and that's a salary bump when you get that
    promotion, and then the next promotion that you can get is Thio from associate
    professor to full professor. And that's another salary bump at that point. And
    that's pretty much it e mean there are other. You can get other raises and things
    like that for merit or for whatever but e I mean, honestly, being being in a state
    university system, um, you know, we have had I remember years where we didn't
    even get cost of living raise is because the budget was the state budget was so
    tight. Um, so the way that I think about it is that you know, there's really just
    two times that you get a raise, and that raises a percentage of whatever your
    starting salary waas. So it can make it difficult to say, like, what's the average
    salary range for professors? Because a lot depends on essentially, how long they've
    been professors and what what was the going rate when they were hired. And so,
    for instance, one of the things that sometimes happens within departments is you
    get this weird kind of like lopsided, um, situation where people who have been
    teaching people who have been professors for you know, decades are actually making
    less than new brand new professors just coming in. And the reason for that is
    that you know, the people who have been teaching there for a really, really long
    time were hired at a point when the starting or base salary was a lot lower. And
    while they may have been getting raises throughout their careers, there's mainly
    those two and their a percentage of whatever salary you started at and so you
    can get to, you know, even 10% raises. But the cost of living has gone up, or
    inflation or whatever. And so the new people who are being hired are being hired
    at this much higher base salary rate, and they have to do that to be competitive.
    You can't offer, you know, really low salaries and expect to get any candidates
    who want to come to your school. So so for the hiring of the new people they have
    thio offer competitive salaries. And so then you get this situation where you
    have newer people who come in on are making mawr than people who have been there
    for 30 years, and that can be kind of weird and awkward sometimes. But that's
    part of working at a state institution. I think is that you know, we're really
    our budgets are limited by the state budget, so you know the range. I think I'm
    gonna say anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000. I think 100 30 is probably pretty
    high. I think most professors are closer to, like the $100,000 mark, Um, per year,
    But honestly, I'm not I'm not entirely sure.

    feel very stuffy inside to say, Call me Doctor Trev. It like, Who are you, lady?
    But a friend of mine who is also a doctor and an academic, pointed out to me that
    particularly for women, it's important for us. Thio claim our titles. Um, and
    part of the reason for that is that you know, if you don't see examples of female
    doctors, then particularly if you're a female, you may think that that is just
    not a possibility that's open to you. And even if you're not a female, you may
    just assume that females just aren't doctors because you haven't seen any of them.
    So that's the reason that I actually do like to have my want my students to call
    me doctor, um, to acknowledge the title because I want other students. I want
    to be an example. Thio future students that Yeah, I'm a doctor. I'm a woman. I'm

  transcript: I actually started my college career at San Diego State University,
    which is part of the CSU system. Um, but it's obviously in San Diego and I went
    there because my dad and my step mom lived in Orange County and I did not want
    to live at home. And so I literally took a compass and a map and I drew a circle
    around where my dad lived and any school that fell into that circle I did not
    apply to because I didn't want to be close enough so that, theoretically, I could
    live at home. So I ended up going toe San Diego State. For that reason, they were
    far enough away that I couldn't really live at home and commute. But at the same
    time, I was close enough so I could go and do laundry if I needed to you. So I
    was close enough to my family, and I like that Onda. That's really what started
    me at San Diego State, say the ego state. However, at the time Waas really over
    enrolled eso. They had way too many students and it was very hard to get classes
    there and so I was there for two years. I think it was two years and realized
    that at the rate that I was going, it was going to take me another at least 3
    to 4 years to get all of the classes that I needed to graduate. And I didn't want
    to be in college for that long. On dso I made the decision that I really needed
    Thio choose a different school. Um, now I wanted the work that I had done to follow
    me, and so I thought that my best bet for that would be to stay in the CSU system.
    And so I looked at the different CSU campuses, and Fullerton had a good psych
    department and they had, you know, a lot of really cool things going on. And I
    at that point I kind of knew that I did want to be a psych major. Um and so I
    chose Fullerton for that reason, and that's how I ended up there

    and I by herself essentially, because we we were in Hawaii for the school year.
    And then we would go visit my dad in California during the summer months. Um,
    so she essentially it was totally single parenting it for nine months. A good
    good 9 to 10 months out of every year. And watching her do that, I think taught
    me that, you know, women can do a lot. Um, I don't think either of my parents
    were particularly sexist at all. If anything, they were not that, um, but watching
    the example of my mom kind of head a family all by yourself on her own and and
    figure it out, Um, really, I think contributed to my sense of possibility and
    just ability. My dad, you know, he was a clinical psychologist. And so from early
    as I can remember, I've always kind of known what psychology waas and talked about

  transcript: I think it's really neat, actually, that I am but alum because I feel
    that that I've had the experience of being a student at Cal State Fullerton. I
    know you know some of the common problems that students have, but I also know
    some of the, you know, the strength that our students have and s So I think that
    it's just that experiential edge that you get. Um, I love the students at Cal
    State Fullerton. I think there's just such a great group. There's such a great
    demographic group. They're so hard working and they are just ready for challenges.
    And they're so resourceful there, So resourceful. Um, I've talked with other friends
    who worked at different universities, even, you know, around the country. Um,
    and I have to say, like, I think that my student group my students are students
    at Cal State Fullerton are just some of the most awesome students, um, that I've
    ever had the privilege to work with on DSO. I do think that being a mum, being
    an alum is kind of a useful thing for me because I kind of know, like some of
    the ins and outs I mean It's definitely changed since I was there Is a a young
    student. Um, but, you know, some things were still the same, and I think that
    that gives me a little bit more like knowledge of, like, the infrastructure of
    Cal State Fullerton. Like, I'm a little more familiar with that than maybe somebody
    who wasn't a student there. So I think there are some advantages to being in a
    lump.

  transcript: I think the culture that I most identify with is white, upper middle
    class American. I don't even know if an American is a culture, but I think it
    might be, um I definitely grew up, I would say, surrounded mostly by white people
    until I moved to Hawaii, and then it was very different. Um, in Hawaii, the I
    don't know what culture actually dominates because there are a lot of different,
    um, Asian cultures that are their own unique cultures. So collectively, I guess
    they dominate numbers wise, but they're not a single entity. So So it z not that,
    but white people are not the majority. I could definitely I can say that. Um,
    so that was very different on drily. Awesome, too, because it just, you know,
    show me a different perspective on life that there are a lot of different ways
    to be their different family structures. They're different foods, They're different
    traditions and customs. And I think that that z one of my favorite things, actually
    about growing up in Hawaii, Um, I think that my culture in California when I was
    a kid was much more homogenized. Um, and it was very much like, yeah, white, middle
    to upper middle class, professional, you know. But that's about it, So yeah,

  transcript: I think I had a pretty good childhood. Um, my parents were good people.
    My dad was a clinical psychologist. He worked a lot. He was He really loved his
    work. Um, so he was kind of doing that most of my early childhood. And then, um
    when we when my mom and my brother and I moved to Hawaii, that was that was a
    little traumatic. We didn't know anybody there. I mean, she had some people there
    from when she had lived there as a child. Um, but her parents, my grand parents
    who didn't know very well because they lived in Hawaii way didn't see them that
    often, but they had both died, Um, and so she had, like, old friends of families,
    But that was about it. So none of us really knew anybody. So it was kind of like
    starting over again. And I had to go to a new school. Um, but, you know, I got
    over it. I made friends, and then I grew up in Hawaii, and it's funny, because
    people sometimes when they hear that they're like, Oh, my gosh, you grew up in
    Hawaii. It was really wasted on me. as a kid. It was just kind of like, This is
    the place I grew up. Eso it had good things and bad things. You know, we spent
    a lot of time at the beach. We spent a lot of time outdoors. Um, but it was also,
    for me, a little confining. So, for instance, when I finished high school, my
    Onley objective at that point was to leave Hawaii and go someplace else. Um, my
    brother, on the other hand, loves it. And he would actually live there right now
    if he could. But it's really, really expensive to live there, so it's not really
    practical. Um, so I think All in all, I had a good childhood. I had good friends
    and close family and, you know, some some minor bumps in the road, but nothing,
    nothing too bad.

  transcript: So when I was growing up, I wanted to be a lot of things. I wanted to
    be a ballerina because I was a young girl growing up in America. So I think that
    was a pretty standard one. Um, I wanted to be a cowgirl. I wanted to be a singer,
    even though I can't sing. But that's okay. Details A Z. I got older when I was
    in high school and starting to kind of consider careers. Um, I wanted to be ah,
    lot of different things the U 19 or the unifying factor in all of the things that
    I wanted to be where they were things that would, uh, make me very, very rich.
    I think what I really wanted was freedom, Andi. I saw I saw money is a means to
    that. So I just I didn't really care what I was. I just wanted to have a lot of
    money. Um, so I was gonna be a lawyer. I was going to be, uh, senator, Like, I
    was going to go into politics, um, business for a half second, because that never
    really appealed to me, but it didn't seem to be lucrative. Um And then when I
    got to college, we had thio. So when I went to college, I started my college journey
    at San Diego State University, which is part of the CSU system down in San Diego.
    And at that time, the university was really, really impacted. And so you had to
    declare your major as a freshman. Most universities are not going to require you
    to do that because, of course, who knows what they want to dio when they're just
    starting college? Some people do, but most people don't so But the time at San
    Diego State you had to declare a major right off the bat. So I didn't really know
    what to declare. Um, so I kind of chose my major based on some other factors.
    So number one I didn't like math, and I didn't like science, so I didn't. So all
    of those majors went right out the window. Then I wasn't. I liked art, but I wasn't
    super artsy. Um, you know, like music. But I didn't know anything about music,
    so I didn't think I would do well in those things. So those went out the window
    and I liked history. But Then I looked at the course requirements and there were
    a lot of classes that I would have to take that I was not really interested in.
    So I was like, um so I actually finally settled on psychology as my major. So
    I went into college as a psych major. But the reason for that was not because
    I was particularly interested in psychology. The main reason for it was that it
    was kind of a science, but not like biology or chemistry or physics kind of science.
    And my dad had been on at the time Waas a clinical psychologist. And so, you know,
    growing up, that was always a topic at the dinner table, you know, and he had
    a private practice. And so, you know, we talked a lot about psychology and psychological
    constructs and things like that. Also, I waas. I was a delightful adolescent who
    knew everything. And so my reasoning went that my dad was an idiot and he could
    do this so clearly, this would be something very easy for me to dio. So that was
    essentially why I picked psychology as my major. Now that said, fast forward into
    my college experience. I switched majors, and I'm gonna put that in air quotes
    because I never actually filed the paperwork to do it. So my whole college career
    I'm on record is being a psych major. But in my mind, I changed my major probably
    six times in the first two years of my college career. And really, it kind of
    went it was based on the teachers that I had. So when I had a class, that Haddon
    amazing teacher, I was like, This is it. This is what I'm doing with my life.
    Absolutely. I found my passion and my calling. And so I was a geology major for
    a while, I waas, uh, going to major in foreign languages for a while, and then
    I was going to be an interpreter for the u. N. That was that was a plan. Um, I
    was gonna be a history major. I was going to be an English major, and I think
    Oh, I said geology. So yeah, so those are the ones that I remember off the top
    of my head, but oh, anthropology. I was gonna be an anthropology major for a while.
    It pretty much changed a couple of times each semester, and it really was based
    on the teachers that I had. So the the short answer, I guess to this question
    is that I wanted to be a lot of things when I was growing up, and the thing that
    I am doing now is something that I never, ever, ever thought I would be doing,
    and yet I absolutely love it.

  transcript: When I started college, I started at San Diego State University, and
    at the time the university was impacted, which meant that they had too many students,
    and so their policy was to have students declare their major as incoming freshmen.
    So as soon as you started there, you had to declare a major. And so I didn't know
    really what I wanted to do with that point. But I had to pick something, so I
    e chose my major really, by a process of elimination. So I looked through the
    catalog at all of the available majors, and I decided, you know, I didn't want
    to do anything that had to do with math because I didn't like math. I didn't want
    anything to do with science because I didn't like things like chemistry and stuff
    like that. So all of that stuff just went gone out the window on gun I you know,
    I wasn't really good at art or music. So those you know, I didn't consider those
    p No, thank you. I wasn't gonna do anything like that. So, you know, kind of as
    I went through and just toss things, the pool got smaller and smaller. Um, And
    then once, I kind of had a few choices, mostly in the humanities and social sciences.
    I started looking at the requirements. Andi also just kind of thinking of my own
    abilities. Like, could I really do this on Guy? Honestly landed on psychology
    Mawr. So not so much because I loved psychology and wanted to know more. My father
    was a clinical psychologist, and so we had always, you know, I knew a lot about
    psychology just from dinner table talk kind of stuff. Um, and so I just kind of
    plumped on that major because I knew something about it. It was reasonably interesting,
    I guess. Andi, I I definitely felt that well, if my dad could do it, and you know
    he was an idiot because I was that kind of kid. Um, then I could do it. So that
    was really what made my decision to choose. Psychology is my major

  transcript: the fact that my father was a clinical psychologist really did affect
    my career choice. Not in the way that it might seem, but really, it was because
    of him that I chose. Psychology is a major initially, um, and that was just because
    the fact that he was a clinical psychologist, number one it meant that I was pretty
    familiar with a lot of psychological constructs because it was just things that
    we talked about at home. Um, and also, you know, he did it. Most of his friends
    were colleagues, and, you know, and they did it. And as a teenager, you know,
    I was looking at them and just going like, Well, you all are a bunch of idiots.
    So clearly this is something that, you know, I could dio because I'm so much smarter
    than you. Um, so that was really what set me on the path of psychology. And I
    mean, I did find it somewhat interesting, but it really wasn't the love of psychology
    that had was the reason that I chose psychology as a major, but it was definitely
    influenced by the fact that my dad was a clinical psychologist.

  transcript: I think the better question here is what other majors did I not consider?
    I switched my major so many times during my college grow and not officially so
    I didn't officially ever filed paperwork to switch my major, But in my in my mind,
    I switched my major. I'm going to say at least twice a semester for the first
    2 to 3 years. And what determined this was was really the professors that taught
    the classes that I took. So when I took a class with a great professor and they
    brought all of their passion into the classroom, it was infectious. And I caught
    the bug like every time. And so if you look at my my career or my major over the
    first three years of my college education, you know, I started with psychology,
    but other ones that I considered or you know, kind of switched to were geology
    Anthropologie, uh, foreign language. I was gonna be a translator for the u. N.
    I still think that would have been a good, good career choice. But anyways, um
    history English, I think that might have been it. There might have been a few
    more in there. Um, really. I changed my mind all the time. I was just kind of,
    you know, whatever got me excited. I was like, This is what I'm doing. Everything
    else is dead to me. I'm doing this now, so I changed my major quite a bit.

  transcript: I teach psychology at Cal State Fullerton University. Uh, in particular.
    I teach bio psychology, which is kind of the intersection of biology and then
    psychology. Eso We're kind of looking at psychological constructs like cognition
    and emotions and behavior through the lens of biology. So when you're angry, what
    is what's going on in your brain? What's going on in your body like what's changing
    versus when you're not angry? Um, I teach that as a lecture. I also have a lab
    component to that, and then the other classes that I teach. I teach psychopharmacology,
    which is specifically looking at how drugs and other substances affect the brain
    and how then that plays out into things like changes in behavior and changes in
    perception. Um, and we also cover, like addiction and things like that on day.
    Then I teach intermediate research methods and statistics, which is awesome class,
    where we're kind of putting together the information that students learn about
    basic statistics with the information they learn about basic research design.
    So we're kind of now looking at them both simultaneously on bond answering questions
    like, Well, if this is, you know, if this is how I planned my experiment. Then
    what kind of statistics do I need to use Thio? Show what I want to show on DSO
    There's the four classes that I teach. Um and other, Aside from my teaching, I
    also do research. And the main focus of my personal research is looking at how
    what we eat effects, how we feel. So I'm the kind of formal version of that is
    the effect of nutrition on mental health and learning and in mental when I say
    mental health, what I'm really looking at is depression and anxiety. Eso yeah,
    essentially, I'm just looking at you know how what we eat effects, how we feel
    and how we learn. And I think it's a really fascinating, uh, topic at one of the
    things I love about it is that it's very accessible, like all of us eat. All of
    us eat every single day. Most of us eat, and what we are eating has some really
    strong impacts on how we're feeling and how we're learning. The other thing that
    I do in terms of research is I'm part of a research group on campus that looks
    at, um, fibromyalgia, which is a disease state that, uh, the main feature of it
    is pain. So we look at fibromyalgia and also other types of diseases that are
    plagued by pain. Um, and this is, ah, study where we've it's called a longitudinal
    study where we've actually followed people over. Now it's over a decade, and they
    come in every couple of years, and we take a lot of bunch of we take a lot of
    different measurements from them. So we look at things like, you know, how are
    they moving? We have a lot of physical measurements. We also have cognitive measurements.
    So we give them a lot of like cognitive tests on day. Then we also do like, you
    know, emotional test like, How are you feeling that kind of stuff? And then we
    take all sorts of other data on them. On Ben, we can look at the data. We can
    look at it year by year, so we could look at just a given year, and we have people
    who have fibromyalgia and other pain conditions, and we also have people who don't.
    So we we kind of these air are control groups. Eso we can compare people within
    a given year. But we can also look at people across here so we can see how you
    know, for instance, one of the questions that I'm working on right now is for
    the people who have fibromyalgia are the ones who are taking particular types
    of medications in this case, antidepressants. Are they faring better over time?
    Compared Thio? People who have fibromyalgia who aren't taking antidepressants.
    And so that's the question that were that I am personally looking at in this Richard
    group right now.

  transcript: I actually did not choose this career, Really. I mean, I guess I did,
    But I was not looking for this career. I was working. So in 2000 and three, I
    was working in a research lab at U. C. I and I was a post doctoral students, so
    that meant that I had already got my PhD and I was doing research under the guidance
    of more senior researcher. And I had just gotten a grant from the National Institute
    of Health that would support my work for three years. So I, you know, I was very
    happy with the project that I was doing and, you know, was not looking for a job.
    And my old mentor, Dr Margaret White, who worked at Cal State Fullerton in the
    psychology department, and she taught the Biocyte classes, and I had just loved
    her classes. They really spoke to me amid the sea of all the other psychology
    classes, so I had actually developed a relationship with her. I served as her
    graduate assistant when I was in the Masters program at Cal State Fullerton before
    I went into my PhD program, and she had just remained a friend and a mentor throughout
    grad school on into my post, doc. And so she contacted me and told me that she
    was planning on retiring. She had made the decision to retire and that they were
    going Thio do a search to replace her, replace, find someone to replace her. And
    she wanted me to apply for the position. And I said, You know, I just got this
    grant. I'm really happy I'm in the middle of this big research program and I love
    what I'm doing. You know, I don't I don't want to apply for this job. And I didn't
    want to be a teacher. I wanted Thio be a researcher and go into industry. Um,
    and so being a teacher had really never been on my radar and she said, You know,
    that may be true right now, but it's always a good you know. This is good practice.
    You, you know, it's it's a good idea to apply for jobs. Before you know you're
    really wanting to find a job. Consider a practice. Go in. Just get your resume
    together, get all your stuff together again. This is good practice to get all
    these documents together. now and just go and apply. And so I did, and they called
    me back and I had a phone interview, and then they asked me to come in an interview,
    and I went in and I gave a lecture and the talk, Um, and I ended up getting hired.
    And that, I guess, is when I chose because I was like, Well, I can stay here at
    U C. I doing the research that I'm doing and really enjoying Or, you know, I've
    been offered this job at Cal State Fullerton and, you know, honestly, I don't
    even know what it was that made me take the job. I mean, I really loved Cal State
    Fullerton. I had gone there as a student and, you know, really had a fondness
    for the department. And I think, part of what made me go what made me choose it
    at that particular moment in time was that when I was a student at Cal State Fullerton,
    nobody was doing the kind of research that I wanted to do. Nobody was doing this
    kind of more biologically based research, and it was very frustrating for me because,
    you know, I wanted to do research, but I didn't really want to Do, you know, I
    didn't want to do a research project that I wasn't super interested in. Um and
    so I really That was kind of what What made me take the job is that I thought,
    you know what? I can make it kind of my goal to bring this kind of research to
    this department so that if there are other students like me who want to learn
    more about this and actually want some hands on experience, well, at least they
    will have, you know, some kind of opportunity. It may not be exactly what they
    want to do, but it will be closer than you know, what's what's on offer right
    now. And I think that that's really what motivated my decision ultimately to take
    the job.

    and psychology is the study of human beings. Um and so I think that makes it very

    is a science and eso while we may be studying human beings, we're doing that in
    a very, uh, very kind of structured method. A logical way on DWI collect data.
    And we analyzed data, which means we need to know things like statistics and stuff
    like that. So I think that there are parts of it that, um can be thought of is
    to be, like, harder or just more challenging. Um, and then there are parts that
    are easier, but honestly, I think the same can be said for every major

    and things like that. There's cultural psychology, looking at different cultures.
    There is a sensation and perception, which is kind of like bio psychology. And

    focusing on how we bring sensory information into our bodies and how we process

    So there's, you know, from birth, maybe even before birth. Thio death. Um, there's
    bio psychology, which is my preferred realm, um, their statistical psychology.

  transcript: I would have to say that the best area of or branch of psychology to
    study is bio psychology, and that may be because I love it. And I'm biased. Absolutely.
    That's probably why I'm saying that. But I truly, truly believe in my heart that
    bio psychology, that understanding that we are biological entities and therefore
    all of the amazing things that we dio all of them, like just from simple stuff
    like choosing. You know, Thio, eat this instead of this or go right instead of
    left all the way up to writing symphonies and building, you know, bridges and
    all of these crazy things that we dio all of this. All of this is based in the
    fact that we're biological entities and we are. That is where everything that
    we do comes from, and so understanding how that biology effects, all of the things
    that we're capable of doing is hugely important. And I feel that this is the direction
    that psychology, just as the whole field is kind of going towards and it will
    become more biological and more biological as we go along. And I mean, if we look
    at psychology from the 18 hundreds to now. I mean, it's completely more biologically
    centered than it ever waas back then, and I think that trend is on Lee going to
    continue. And so for that reason, I would argue that biological psychology is
    the most important domain within the overall field of psychology. But I do admit
    that I'm probably biased.

  transcript: the time it takes to finish the degree is based on first of all, what
    degree we're talking about. And then, second of all, what? What you're doing for
    that degree. So a bachelor's degree generally takes 4 to 5 years for most students.
    And, of course, there's, you know, people on either side of that. So some people
    can take a little shorter, some a little longer. But most people are going to
    take between four and five years to finish their bachelors degree. Ah, master's
    degree is generally going to take anywhere between two and three years, and then
    a PhD degree is generally going to take somewhere between four and six years,
    and the differences in all of these degrees why there's kind of a range has to
    do with exactly what you're doing. So, for instance, if we're looking at the bachelor's
    degree, some majors require mawr classes than other majors Dio, and so those majors
    just may take a little bit longer for someone to complete all the classes that
    they need. Um, same thing is true in a master's program. Generally, they take
    two years, but some programs require more work. They require, uh, different classes
    and maybe the classes are offered all the time. So again, that can add to the
    length of time in the degree program. When we're looking at like a PhD degree,
    Um, oftentimes that's going to depend to ah ah, large extent on the type of research
    that you are engaged in as a PhD student. So So, one of the requirements the biggest
    requirement of the PhD degrees that you contribute something new Thio the, uh,
    in terms of research. So you have to do like a new study with new data and show
    something knew that adds to the field. And so depending on the kind of work that
    you're doing that can really affect your time, um, to finishing the project and
    getting your degree. So, for instance, an example of this Is that the lab that
    I got my Ph. D. N? We did behavioral work, uh, in in rodents and our studies went
    pretty quickly. So they lasted, you know, maybe a couple months. You know, a long
    study would be a study that lasted maybe four months, something like that on dso
    It was possible. Thio, you know, do ah whole research program, essentially in
    a relatively short period of time. And so I ended up getting my PhD in a almost
    exactly four years. And then when I went thio work at U. C I in the lab there,
    I you know, I already had my PhD at that point. But the graduate students who
    are working on their PhDs in that lab, the way the research that was being done
    in that lab took a lot longer. So they were doing, um, work that required waiting
    for stains to emerge in various tissues, usually brain tissue on. I mean, it could
    take four weeks for Thio, even see if the stain worked out right. So So the students
    in that lab, one of them took five years, and one of them took six years to get
    their PhD work done. And that's just because the type of work that they were doing
    had just a much longer time course. So there can be some variability there

    many years or so many semesters. And I was, you know, I mean, it took me five
    years to get my bachelor's degree, which at the time I felt like, you know, I
    was behind. And then instead of going right into a PhD program, I went through
    a master's program and, you know, and so again I was behind, you know, And I felt
    like when I got to my PhD program, you know, I was I was behind all of the other
    students who graduated college in four years and then went right into a PhD program.
    Um, and what I realized now, from the vantage point of, you know, 30 years later,
    is that it doesn't matter. You know, if it took me six years to get my bachelor's
    degree it really wouldn't have changed my life all that much if I had to take
    me three years to get my Masters degree or seven years to get my PhD. Just I don't
    think that in the end it really would have made a huge difference in the quality
    of my life, my happiness, um, any of those things. So I think that if I could
    go back and do it again, I would just relax a little bit in terms of like the

    that was a lot for me. Um, I think another struggle was watching. This was especially
    true when I got into graduate school, um, watching my friends and peers who had,
    you know, gone from a bachelor's degree into a career path. And so they were now
    developing their careers, and I was still in school. And so, you know, they were
    starting to make money and by cars and, you know, have nicer apartments and go

    you know, maybe, like right out of the bachelor's degrees. Um, there, you know,
    maybe they're making money, but maybe they're not making as much money as they
    need to be happy, I guess you could say, And that's because they're not super

  transcript: um I think early in my life, e I was very afraid of failure. You know,
    failure meant that I wasn't doing what I was supposed to dio, um, I wasn't good
    enough. I wasn't smart enough. I wasn't working hard enough. Whatever you wanna
    call it. Um, as I've gone through my career and especially as I've become uneducated
    Er, um, and a parent, I should also add I have come to view failure as a process.
    Failure is what you do before you succeed, right? So you just fail and fail and
    fail and fail and fail, and then you succeed. And so failure to me at this point
    does not mean, you know, doing something and having it not work out the way that
    I wanted Thio failure to me means I'm not trying to do something I'm giving up
    before I even begin. Um and so, you know, I think that having things not work
    out having expectations that aren't met. Um, not doing well, all of those things
    are ways that we can adjust our behaviors. We can either. Just our expectations.
    We can adjust our behaviors, weaken, say, like, Oh, maybe this is just how it
    works out, Um, or we could just try something new. This is just part of the process.
    And so I think that I don't look at failure. Like when something doesn't work
    out for me, I don't think Oh, that was a failure, I think. Oh, that didn't work.
    Okay, well, let's let's think about why it didn't work and let's regroup And let's
    do this again and that might that process might have to have to happen 20 times
    before, you know, I get a result that I'm like, Okay, this worked eso That's how
    I look at failure now. Failure means that I'm not trying. I'm not even beginning
    the process. That's what failure is to me now.

  transcript: I've had a lot of role models. Um, my grandmother, when I was much younger,
    was a powerful role model for me. She was very smart woman, very interested in
    a lot of things. Um, like botany and arts and crafts and making things and cooking.
    Um I mean, there, you know, name a craft. She did it and she taught me how to
    do all of them. And so I really learned how Thio make a lot of things. And I think
    that the overall thing that that did for me is it kind of taught me that, like,
    I could do a lot of stuff. I could make a lot of stuff so often times, you know,
    when I'm out and about in the world shopping or something, and I'll see something
    and I'll be like, Oh, that's really cool. And then my second thought will be like,
    I could make that Andi. I think that that really came from her influence, that
    that kind of ability or confidence in my own abilities Thio make something. Um
    and then my mom has been a really strong role model for me. Um, in that she is
    a very independent woman. I think for her she was a little ahead of her time.
    She came from kind of a more conservative family with more conservative gender
    roles, which she pretty much defied her whole life and in some ways paid the price
    for that. Um, but she's always just lived really true to herself. And, um, that
    has been important for me in my own life, to kind of have that influence to see
    like, yeah, you just you need toe make your rules. And the rules you follow are
    the ones that make sense to you. You don't just, you know, let other people, for
    instance, do your thinking for you. You you think things out for yourself. Um
    and then my stepmother has been amazing role model to me. She had had a pretty
    high powered career in in health care while she was also raising my younger brothers
    and, you know, watching her kind of achieve that balance, or at least a semblance
    of that balance. But, you know, between having a career that she was just really
    passionate about and really loved, and then also having a family, that she was
    very devoted thio, um and seeing you know how she kind of managed that, um was
    really, really important for me and especially once I became a parent, I relied
    on her wisdom and advice on how to kind of manage both of these really important
    parts of my life.

    friend today, and we, you know, see each other regularly, and I'm still I still

    Um, and he really taught me how to be an independent researcher. Um, taught me
    a lot about you know, how toe develop a research program and and kind of run a
    lab. And, um, he's someone that I also I'm still in contact with, and I call him

  transcript: so there's a lot of variability in salaries, depending on so many factors.
    So I think in general it is true that the more advanced degree that you have,
    the higher your overall salary range, is going to be. So. Usually people with
    PhDs are going to make more money than people who have master's degrees, who are
    going to make more money than people with bachelor's degrees. And that's just
    kind of like, I think, a general trend. It's not always true. Um, the other thing
    that's really going toe affect your salary range is what you're actually doing.
    So, for instance, my husband and I have the exact same degree. We worked in the
    same exact lab in graduate school, so we have a carbon copy of each other's degrees.
    He went into the pharmaceutical industry. I went into academics. He makes I'm
    going to say conservatively four times what I make with the exact same degree.
    So what you do, I think, is probably the biggest factor that affects how much
    you make, which is, you know, that makes sense. So the question is, what do you
    want to dio like? If if you're if you're making this decision based on, like,
    a salary range, Like I You know, I don't want to do anything where I'm gonna be
    making less than a certain amount. For instance, I think the best way to figure
    out salary ranges is to narrow down the actual position that you see and a great
    place to do. This is the career center. So if you go to the Career Center, they
    have so much information on different types of jobs or different types of careers,
    and you can look at those careers and see Okay, this seems like a good one. That
    seems like a good one. That seems like something I would be interested in. And
    then once you've chosen, like, a handful of careers, you can then you either through
    the career center or just through something like Google. You can probably find
    salary ranges for that type of position. So that would be if I was trying to figure
    out, like, okay, if I decided Thio leave my career and become a research assistant
    in a biotech lab. How much would I make? Well, you know, once I decided. Okay,
    this is what I want to do. I want to do. I wanna be a research assistant in a
    biotech lab. I could then go onto the Internet. Or I could go to the career center
    and say, Okay, What? You know, what kind of salaries are you seeing for people
    in this position? And so that might be a really good way. Thio kind of get some
    good data on actual salaries.

  transcript: That is a great question. And it's a really long and winding story.
    Um, my career path or trajectory from kind of like when I started, let's say in
    college and now is not a linear process. It all, um or at least not a straight
    line. Um, if I had to maybe isolate some key decisions, that kind of got me to
    where I am now, I think that the first one probably would have been taking that
    taking the bio psychology class when I was still working on my bachelors degree.
    Um, I had entered psychology initially, just kind of with the assumption that
    I was going to be a clinician. Um, but honestly, my heart really wasn't in it.
    I much preferred, you know, like, kind of like biology and those types of things
    on dso. When I took the bio psychology class, it was this this wonderful marriage
    of biology and psychology, and that was the class that really just set me on fire.
    And I was like, I need to know more about this. Um, now, unfortunately, I took
    that class literally the spring that I was supposed to graduate. So I was, like,
    done with my bachelor's degree at that point. And so here I waas like, this is
    what I want to dio but I don't know anything about it. And so I ended up enrolling
    in graduate school and first I was in a master's program, um, and learn more about
    it, and that made me just love it even more. And so at that point, I decided I
    wanted to keep going with my education. And that was probably the second big decision
    that I made was I'm going to pursue ah ph. D in bio psychology Neuroscience. Um,
    so I did that and, you know, learned even more about this amazing field and consistently
    was inspired and just loving what I dio eso I finished my PhD degree. I took a
    job in a postdoctoral position. Um and then I would say the next day Biggest piece
    of the puzzle. Waas. Some one of my mentors encouraged me. Thio apply Thio Cal
    State Fullerton. They were looking for someone to teach bio psychology and she
    encouraged me to apply, and honestly, at the time, I wasn't really interested.
    I was I was in the middle of a big project that I was very engaged in Andi. I
    wasn't looking. Thio become a teacher anyways. Um, but she said she just advised
    me like, Just do it. Just do it for the practice. If nothing else, just get you.
    You're gonna be on the job market soon, so just get used to interviewing. And
    this is great practice for you. And so I did. I put my application together and
    I applied, and I actually did get a call back and an on campus interview, and
    I went and I ended up getting the job, and that was that, and that's that's how
    I got here.

    shall we? So I It took me five years to get my bachelor's degree, and then I was
    in a master's program for two years and then so that's seven years now. Then I
    was in my PhD program for for four years, so that brings us up to 11. I was at
    my post stock position for two years, so that's lucky. 13. So it took me, I guess,
    13 years from when I started my bachelor's degree to when I got my current position

    So there's a new annual conference called the Society for Neuroscience. And I
    remember going to the first one, and I was This was when I was in my PhD program
    and there were it was in this huge convention center and in this one just ginormous
    room, Um, there were probably, like, 1000 posters and so posters, or where researchers
    go to kind of share their latest information and beat with other people who are
    kind of interested in the same things and talk to them. So they were like at least
    1000 posters in this room, and these posters changed from the morning to the evening.
    So in the morning there were 1000 posters, and in the evening there were 1000
    posters, and it did this for five days, and I was just absolutely blown away by
    how many different things people are looking at just really how big this field
    is. Just just neuroscience. Bio psychology, like not even psychology, is a general
    field like so So I think that's amazing. It's it can be very overwhelming. It
    could be like Oh my goodness gracious. But I think the thing that's really exciting
    about it is that if you are kind of like trying to figure out like, Well, what
    do I want to do? Really, there are so many options open to you, anything that
    you can think of. There's probably somebody already semi looking at that or semi
    doing that and you can learn from them. So really, just it's limitless what you
    want to dio.

  transcript: When I was in my bachelor's degree, I thought about changing my major.
    I almost every week, I think, and I kind of did. I just didn't do it like I didn't
    follow the paperwork, but in my mind, I changed my major at least eight times.
    Um, so I really wasn't even settled on psychology until the very end of my bachelor's
    degree. Pretty much, um And then when I was in, um, in my PhD program, I remember
    I almost left. After a couple of years. I was just It was hard and I was over
    it, and I was living in a place that was very different from any place I've ever
    lived before. So I was on the East Coast. It was winter, it was cold and I was
    done. And so I remember talking with a friend of my mentor who was like a recruiter
    for biotech companies. And he said, So are you ready to quit and open a restaurant?
    And I was like, How did you know? And he's like because everybody gets to that
    point S O. I was like, OK, so I ended up staying on. But then even then, after
    I got my PhD. I was planning to go into the pharmaceutical industry because one
    of my, you know, main areas of studies is pharmaceuticals or psychopharmacology.
    How drugs affect the brain and behavior. And so my plan was to go into the pharmaceutical
    industry and kind of work on that type of research. Um, and then I ended up getting
    a job in academic position and ended up falling in love with it. So I mean, all
    throughout my career, I have changed and changed and changed and changed.

  transcript: I think it depends on what time of my life we're talking about in high
    school. I waas uh, okay, student. I wasn't I was never, like, straight A's or
    anything like that. Subjects that interested me. I did well in subjects that I
    hated. I did poorly in, um, I was kind of a shy student, so I didn't, like, seek
    out help. Usually, if I was having trouble, I just kind of suffered in silence
    and then did poorly. Um, and I carried that tradition with me into my bachelor's
    degree, where the courses that I was really interested in I tended to do really
    well in and the ones like the G requirements, the ones I had to take I was less
    engaged in, did not put his much effort into, um and, you know, consequently tended
    not to do as well in those classes. Um, I think that once I got towards the end
    of my bachelor's degree, when I was just pretty much taking classes in psychology,
    I started to do a little bit better overall, Um, mainly because specifically for
    those courses that just weren't as engaging to me, I kind of just started realizing
    that I just needed to do well, Period. At that point, I was kind of thinking about
    the possibility of going to graduate school or doing something beyond just my
    bachelor's degree. And so I know that I I knew at that point that I needed to
    keep my my g p a up, Um And so I you know, I worked a little harder, particularly
    for those classes that just weren't is engaging to me. Um and then, honestly,
    by the time I got to graduate school, I was a great student, but that's because
    I was absolutely 100% engaged. I I loved what I was doing. I loved all of my classes.
    Um, I just love the learning process. And even if a class wasn't something that
    I could directly see, like how I needed to have this information right now, I
    knew that I would probably need it sometime in the future. And so that just kept
    me engaged. So I think I finish really strong as a student. I was a great student
    at the time. I finished my PhD, but I definitely did not start out that way.

    Um, and really, my first two years of college were all about learning how to function
    on my own. So it was my first time living away from home. Um, for the first year,

    other people, like, literally. It was a two bedroom house, and I think there were

    semi adult, Um, in the last bit of my like the last couple of years of my bachelor's
    degree, Um, that's when I had kind of gotten a little bit more serious about school,
    mainly just because I wanted to finish like I did not want to be in. I didn't
    want to be working on my bachelors degree for like, eight years. I wanted to get
    done. Um, s o I was a little bit more focused on this student. Um, and I had,
    you know, kind of figured out the paying my bills and doing my laundry and, you
    know, feeding myself stuff, Thio at least a minimal level. Um, and you know, and
    so I finished my bachelor's degree. And at that point, honestly, first of all,
    I was really interested in bio psychology and wanted to continue exploring it.
    And second of all, I also kind of felt like I am not prepared really to do anything
    like I didn't have, like, a career path, like, Okay, this is my next step. Um
    And so for that reason, I ended up going to graduate school. And so I was in a

    of learning more about career path and what might work for me in psychology. And
    ultimately that led me Thio joining a PhD program

    didn't have the skill set on guy remember taking that general education math required?
    I think it was like 1 10 B or something like that. And I struggled so hard in
    that class and I had to pass it and that wonderful instructor that I had, he was
    the best because he didn't just pass me out of pity or anything like that. Like
    I saw that guy in his office hours pretty much twice a week every week for an
    entire semester, and he worked with me diligently. I will honestly say that I
    still didn't have a great understanding of math when I left the class, but that
    was not due to him and the lack of attempts to teach me he spent so much time
    with me. I think that at that point, my brain was just not really in a place to
    accept that information. So, um, it was no fault of his. But I did manage to pass.
    I actually passed with a B minus. So that's credit right there to him. Um and
    yeah, but that was probably when I look back on just the class that I struggled
    with the most, that was the class.

  transcript: Yeah. Okay, so this is a little bit of a story. So I took a class in
    my second semester. Freshman year of college, in linguistics on I love languages.
    I love Entomology. Where the words come from, how did they change? Um and so I
    took this linguistics class and I had this brilliant, brilliant teacher. She was
    so amazing. She was so engaging on. That was when I changed my major in my mind,
    um, to be foreign language, and I was going to just major in languages and be
    a translator for the U. N. Um, I love that class so much. It was like some ungodly
    hour like, eight o'clock in the morning. And I actually went every single time.
    I never missed a class because I was just so into the material. But she had a
    requirement, which was that you had thio. We had We had all these homework assignments
    in addition to, like, exams and stuff like that. And at the time, you know, my
    thinking was, well, home workers for people who need it. Obviously I don't because
    I clearly have this material down. I love it. I understand it. I literally got
    the highest grade on every single one of her exams. So, you know, obviously didn't
    need to do the homework. And so imagine my surprise. At the end of the semester
    when she failed me, I was stunned. I literally thought it was a mistake. I never
    would have approached a teacher to argue a grade, but I honestly thought this
    was clearly a clerical error. She had assigned me the wrong grade, so I met with
    her and I was like, Yeah, you know, I I understand. You're busy and you have a
    lot of things. I'm totally get it. And she's like, Oh, no, I remember this. She's
    like it broke my heart because you were an amazing student. You were there every
    class. You did really well on the exam. But this was a requirement of the class,
    which I made very clear, and you didn't do it. And so you fail. So that was a
    hard pill to swallow. And so I ended up applying for course forgiveness and taking
    the class again the following semester so that I could just replace that f with
    whatever you're in the next semester. Onley next semester, I got this other professor
    who was awful horrible. The whole class was different. It was terrible. And it
    was so bad, mainly because I knew how good it could have been because I had had
    that experience and it was awesome. And this was just the worst. And I hated it.
    I hated every second of it. I didn't like him as a professor on. I just had to
    suffer through it because of my own terrible decisions.

  transcript: It depends on what you dio. So there is there, there, both of those
    things. Psychology is a science. So we use the scientific method. Um, and a big
    part of what we do is gather data and then analyze that. And so that's kind of
    falling under the sub field of statistics and statistics is math. So So there
    there is kind of a need to have a basic understanding of math, but, ah, lot of
    statistics are really kind of on the level of just basic algebra. Um, so, you
    know, a long as you did pretty well in high school math, you should be OK. Um,
    also incidentally, some people who didn't really like high school math find that
    they really love statistics because even though the statistics uses the same operations
    is algebra. You're thinking about numbers in a different way that, for some people
    like me, makes a whole lot more sense. So I hated math in high school, but I love
    statistics, Onda. Same thing with science. Science is a process, and that's really
    the most important thing that you have to understand is just the process of science.
    When it comes to actual like scientific facts like, you know, how does the cell
    work? That kind of knowledge is not as important for the general field.

    on the other hand, it is, um or, I would say, especially at the bachelor's level,
    it's a more generalized skill set. And so it might be harder for you to get jobs
    that require a very specific skill set. So, like, you know, in mathematics or
    something like that, that might be harder job to get with a degree in psychology.

    paths open to you with a degree in psychology.

    something that you are truly truly interested in. So I would not necessarily follow
    the academic track that you think is going to reward you with a high paying career
    of the end of it. I would I would instead advise you to just pick up a basic psychology
    textbook and skim through it and see if there's any, uh, domains within psychology
    that just really get you excited and you want to know more about that. And that's
    the track that I would say you're gonna be most successful on.

    degree. In fact, most people who graduate with a bachelor's degree in psychology
    are not working in the field of psychology. They're working in other fields. They're
    working in business. They're working in education. They're working in arts and
    entertainment. But psychology gives you that skill set to work with people because
    you understand people better. And so that's why it's such a great major because
    it applies to so many fields.

  transcript: there are some required classes that you have to take and some of those
    you're going to have to take in a certain order. The best place to get information
    about those classes in the order that you need to take them in is either just
    by looking at the psychology department course catalog or by going to the psych
    advising office. After that, you'll have, um, units that you can fill with elective.
    Sometimes you'll have, like, a choice of several different classes, and you just
    need to take one or two choices. Um, and when it comes to those types of things,
    I would just go with what interests you the most. Which what what courses are
    really interesting to you and take those those classes.

  transcript: minors aren't required, but they can be really helpful depending, especially
    on what, um, part of psychology you want to go into. So, for instance, if you
    wanted to go into BIOS psychology, having a minor in either biology or in chemistry
    might be really helpful to you, particularly if you wanted to go on to either
    graduate school, um, or get a job in like the biotech industry.

  transcript: specializations aren't necessary. But they can be helpful to you, particularly
    if you are looking to go either into graduate school or into a career in a particular
    sub field of psychology. Um, we don't have ah lot of concentrations within the
    department. Um, but there are a few so you could do a concentration, for instance,
    in statistics. Or you could do a concentration in bio psychology. Andi, that might
    be really useful to you, depending on your career objectives.

    grab a psych. Wanna one textbook. You can find him at the library and leave through

    and statistical abilities is actually one of the best things that you can get
    out of being a psych major. Um, particularly in my department, we have a lot of
    great statistics. Classes that are offered in statistics is kind of a concentration
    that students can focus on within our departmental offerings, and this is one
    of those things that is going to translate most readily into a marketable skill.

  transcript: so internships are a great way to kind of test the waters in different
    aspects of the field of psychology. So some people do internships that air at
    specific places, like maybe or working with certain populations, like working
    with kids or working with older adults. Um, you could also, though, work in a
    research laboratory, like with a faculty member, and that will also fulfill your
    internship requirement. So I would say, Look into what's most interesting to you,
    particularly in terms of like what you think you might want to be doing five years
    from now and see if you can find an internship that something like that, because
    it will give you a taste of that.

    going to graduate sometime in their Andi. I think the reason for that is that
    internship is something that you don't want to jump into right away. Just because
    you may not know what you really want to dio it's You know, I would take some
    time to figure out what you really think you want to do and then use your internship
    as a way to kind of get your feet wet in that area. Um, but you can take your
    internship earlier than that. Eso I would say any time after you have junior standing
    is, um find Thio. Take your internship.

    department office and they'll tell you who's who's in charge of it. And they usually
    have a list of possible internships and these air like sites that we've worked
    with before. Also, though, you confined your own internship site or person that
    you're gonna be working with, and they can fill out some paperwork and become
    an official internship site, and then you can work with them. So you could either
    look from kind of like a pre approved list or you could go out and find your own
    internship site.

    class so that you have enough time to study the material. Um, if you are having
    problems understanding something, or you just want to go over it again, take advantage
    of your professor's office hours. All professors are required to have office hours,
    so take advantage of those, um, personally, I think forming study groups is a
    really helpful technique, but that's not necessarily true for everybody. But if
    it is true for you, then you know, take the lead and ask some fellow students
    if they want to form a study group that could be really, really helpful and increase

    information that other people have generated eso learning how to think critically
    learning how thio logically evaluate information in terms of its quality is really,
    really important. Um, I think there are other skills that you can work on to develop
    as a psych major in particular, um, skills such a Z empathy, um, and listening
    skills that could be very, very helpful across a multitude of situations. Um,
    but honestly, if I if I had to point a one thing that you really should be trying
    to develop, I would say it's your critical thinking skills.

    skill set. Uh, if they have those skills, that's awesome. That's a bonus for me.
    I don't have to go. I don't have to worry about teaching them how to do things.
    Um, but it is my expectation that students will not come to me with this skill
    set, and and that's part of what we do. What I do in my lab is training them.
    Um, so what I do expect from students is I expect them. Thio have an enthusiastic
    attitude. I expect them to be responsible and reliable. So when they say they're
    going to be there at a certain time, they better be there at a certain time. Because
    I often times have to train students in order for them to participate in my research.
    I dio expect a time commitment from them, so I generally will not take a student
    unless they can commit at least a year to my research, because I find that it
    takes me generally about three months or half a semester to train them in the
    skills that they need in order to be able to participate in the research.

    that not every student is going to be doing and you are forming relationships
    that not every student is going to form. So I think that those were really the

    yeah. And by the way, I can't start working until June. Um, so you know, if, like,
    let's say that you're graduating in May of 2021 I would probably start looking
    for jobs in December, January time. I would start applying for jobs, maybe in
    March or April, somewhere around there, but probably not much sooner than that

    They have a ton of resource is at your disposal. Um, they get job postings from
    all over the place, like they get local job postings. But they also get from national
    companies. Um, they're kind of just a repository of job postings. They also have
    search engines. So even if they don't get the posting directly, they have engines
    that help you search for, you know, specific types of jobs in specific areas of
    the country. Uh, not just locally, So I would absolutely go to the career center
    first.

  transcript: I think my best advice for job searching like kind of beginning a job
    search is to try to be, you know, try to narrow down what you really want to dio
    Um but keep your options open, and so I wouldn't turn down a job that looked pretty
    good, but maybe didn't have some of your requirements. So you don't want to narrow
    it down so much that you know, there's essentially, like, Onley five positions
    in the entire universe. Um, you know, you want to narrow enough to kind of weed
    through things that you know you absolutely don't want. Um but then you want to
    keep it loose enough so that you don't miss opportunities, because sometimes a
    job may look, you know, kind of one way on paper, But then, in reality, it ends
    up, you know, really being close to what you want to dio or, you know, it might
    even turn you in a slightly different direction. So especially when you're new
    thio working professionally, Um, um, I would err on the side of staying open as
    opposed Thio saying No, this isn't what I'm looking for.

    pay attention to that. And it actually does make up impression on people. If you
    don't have a good handshake. Eso so practice that, um, you wanna practice interviewing
    again? The Career center is an excellent resource for this. Uh, they could do
    videotape interviews. They could do mock interviews, and they can You can play
    it back and critique and they could be like, See, when you did that, that was
    really good. And, you know, see, when you did that, don't do that s o. I would
    definitely, um, use that as a resource in prepping for an interview. Um, particularly
    so right now is this is being filmed. We're in the middle of the cove in 19 pandemic
    eso. A lot of things are happening virtually right now, Andi, that includes things
    like job interviews. And that's a different context than a lot of people are used.
    Thio and so prepping for virtual job interview, uh, may look a little different
    than prepping for a regular face to face interview. And so these air also things
    to keep in mind of the context of the interview that you'll be having. And again,
    the Career Center could be really helpful with this.

  transcript: That's a great question. You want ultimately, to have strong, positive
    letters. So my advice is Thio pick people number one who like you, Um, number
    two who know you pretty well. So So one of the most common things that happens,
    for instance, in my own career is I have students who have taken a class with
    me and, you know, have enjoyed the class, maybe came to office hours a couple
    of times and talk to me. And then they're gonna apply for grad graduate school,
    and they asked me if I could write them a letter. And while I'm willing, I always
    advise them that given the very limited nature of our relationship, there is really
    not much I can say about them individually that, you know, couldn't be assessed
    from, like maybe reading their transcripts. And so that's a week letter, you know,
    letters that can't offer anything more than she was a good student and showed
    up to class on time and always raised her hand and knew the right answer. That's
    not a strong letter. Um, um you want someone to be able to testify thio other
    things like your work ethic through experience with you. You know your ability
    to think on your feet your ability to manage adversity and setbacks. Um, you know,
    your leadership abilities. Also, your ability to be a team member thes air, all
    things that are really going to make your letter strong. And so, you know, people
    who can testify to those things are people that you have worked with closely,
    Um, and so you know, you want to You don't want to be in a position of looking
    at who you know who could maybe fill those positions who fit those bills. What
    you really want to dio is you want to start creating those people by, you know,
    starting to work with faculty members starting Thio dio a new internship position.
    Um, you know, finding a job that that has something to do with the skill sets
    that you're going to need to be successful in graduate school. So you want to
    start creating your letter writers instead of trying to find them at some point
    when you want apply to graduate school. The other thing that I would also strongly
    recommend is that you are very up front and say to your letter writers in the
    process of asking them, I would love a strong positive letter of recommendation
    from you. Could you provide me with one? Don't just say, Can you write me a letter?
    Because anyone can write a letter. But you want a strong, positive letter, and
    so you want to be very explicit. And that also gives the faculty member and out.
    Because if they really kind of feel like you know what? I can't They can tell
    you that they can say, You know, I'm not sure if I could write a really strong,
    positive letter, and that kind of gives them an out because you don't want anyone
    writing you a letter. Who is not writing you a strong, positive letter.

  transcript: it can be fairly competitive to get into graduate school. I mean, the
    general state of affairs is that there are more people who want to get into graduate
    school than there are positions in graduate school. Now, that is not always the
    case, but that is usually the case. The Mawr desirable the program or the mentor
    is the harder it's going to be to get in, the more competition there is going
    to be, um, so, you know, if you're feeling like maybe you don't have a really
    high G p A. Maybe you don't have a lot of experience. Maybe you don't have the
    greatest scores on the G r. E. Um, you know, one of the things that you can do
    is you can look into less sought after programs. So, you know, honestly programs
    that Aaron places where, you know, not everybody wants to live. Sometimes they're
    a little bit easier to get into than programs in like New York City or in Los
    Angeles, because a lot of people want to be there. Um, so you know, that might
    help you in terms of like the number of applications, but you can. Usually, they
    usually keep those stats so you can assess that. Like how much competition you're
    gonna have. Um, most programs do have data on you know how many applications they
    get every year versus how Maney positions they award every year. And so you can
    kind of get a feel for how competitive a particular program is going to be.

    I've had who've applied to graduate programs and haven't gotten into the ones
    that they wanted to get into or maybe just didn't get into any at all, um, most
    frequently what I counsel them to do is Thio pursue a job. You know, try to get
    a job in that kind of general area. Eso again if they wanted Thio get into a graduate
    program, maybe a master's program for working with people struggling with addiction
    and they didn't get into any programs. I would say, you know, see if you could
    get a job working with recovering addicts or, you know, in that kind of general
    area of work and do that for a little while. Number one. It's great experience.
    And it's really telling because you may find out that, you know, you just don't
    want to do this kind of work after all, because oftentimes what we think work
    is gonna be like is not exactly what it turns out to be. And so you may find that
    this is just actually not the job for you, which is super valuable information
    um, but maybe you find Yes, you are absolutely right. This is your chosen population.
    You love working with this group, and you are more committed than ever to go toe
    graduate school and get, you know, in advance degree. And in that case, absolutely
    reapply. Reapply to those same schools. If anything, your application is stronger
    now because you've got this fantastic experience behind you. Now, um, and that
    and you're bringing that into the mix now. So you've got something that you didn't
    have when you applied initially, eso you absolutely can apply to the same program
    more than once. And remember, too, that sometimes the decisions about you know
    how many people a program except have nothing to dio with you or your application.
    It has to do with funding. You know who may be the person in the program that
    you wanted to work with. They just don't have enough funds to take any students.
    Or maybe the person that you wanted to work with just doesn't have enough funds
    to take on another student. But maybe they will next year. So absolutely try again

    really really matters and, you know, or it's gonna look impressive on your your
    CV or something like that. And so that might increase your chances of getting
    a position. Um, I think that honestly, the most important thing is who you were,
    who you worked with and what kind of work you did. Um, And mainly because this
    is where you're going to establish your network. You know, doing doing the work
    is where you're going to meet other people who are doing that same kind of work
    or similar work, or at least working in a similar area. And this is the basis
    of your network. And so when you go to find a job in this area, these are the
    people who are gonna know who's hiring or who were going to be at companies that
    you're interested in working for eso. In that sense, I think that the you know,
    the work you dio and the people that you meet while you're doing that work are

  transcript: I would say it's pretty difficult. Um, graduate school is unlike undergraduate
    in that it's really not meant to be a part time thing. Most graduate programs,
    both at the Masters level and at the PhD level, are designed to be full time programs.
    And so that's kind of the expectation is that you are a full time student, Um,
    and that's reflected in things like coursework in hours that you need to put in
    for various you know, internships and things like that, or or research projects,
    Um, and so holding a job particularly a full time job while being a full time
    graduate student, um, can be really difficulty. Now there are some programs. There
    are some graduate programs that are especially designed for, for instance, like
    working professionals Onda. Those tend Teoh be a little bit more flexible. And
    although they may take, you know mawr like it might take you longer in terms of
    maybe like years to get out of them in terms of like hours per day. Your it's
    less and so that's why it takes longer is because its's like you're going, you
    know, part time as opposed to going full time. Um But in general, no, I mean,
    in general, if you're a graduate student, that is your full time job is being
    a graduate student.

  transcript: I think that you have to look at this from the perspective of you're

    investing your time and your investing your money. And so to me, what that means
    is that the most important thing is that I am successful in graduate school. I
    want to get the most out of this investment that I've made of my time and money.
    Um, and I think that to do that, you really need to prioritize being a student
    over being anything else. So anything that you're doing that's not being a student
    is essentially detracting from your ability to be a student. Um And so in that
    case, I would say the preferable alternative in terms of your ultimate success
    and graduate school is to take out loans as opposed to to try to hold down a job
    at the same time. Now, you may be able to find a job that works into your schedule
    and, you know, and doesn't take away from, for instance, your study time or something
    like that. Um, you know, it may also depend on your situation. Um, but in general,
    you know if you're a graduate student, whether it's a master student or a PhD
    student, it is expected that your full time job is being a student.

  transcript: there are a couple of different ways that you can pay for graduate school.
    Um, one is that you can somehow get money. Um, you can either get loans, which
    you have to pay back, But generally there is a fairly low interest rate. Um, and
    usually the the payback terms are, um, pretty easy. Um, although you may end up
    paying quite a lot back Soto really look into it about, you know, if you paid
    you know so much, it's such an interest rate. How long would it take you to pay
    the loan back? And then what would be the total amount that you paid versus the
    actual amount of the loan? That's math worth doing. If you are in in that situation,
    do that math. Um, you can also sometimes get grants and grants are great because
    you don't have to pay him back grants or just kind of like money free money on
    dso. I would work with the financial aid officer at the school where your program
    is house because oftentimes you know there may be grants that you're not even
    aware of. Um, there are a lot of societies that offer grants that are not really
    well publicized, so people don't know about him. So definitely take a look at
    all the possible grants that you can get. And if you could get a grant versus
    alone, Absolutely. Get a grant. Um, the other thing that you can dio is you can
    work and you can make money. Um, now, in general, when you're going to graduate
    school, your primary job is being a student. And graduate schools are generally
    set up as full time programs, which means you cannot do them part time. Eso. The
    expectation is that you are a full time student, Um, and you know, that's really
    serious. And in graduate school, you know, it's a higher level of class work,
    and so you're going to be working harder. It's going to be more difficulty. Just
    the material itself is going to be more difficult thing what you experience in
    your bachelor's degree. So having a job during graduate school can sometimes be
    tricky. It's not impossible, Um, but it can be kind of difficult. So, you know,
    these are things to consider as you're looking at financing graduate school. Most
    of the people that I know who went through graduate school did it with a combination
    of all three of these things. So they had, you know, they got some grants, but
    they also took out some loans and they might have had, you know, a job or something
    like that.

  transcript: I would visit the financial aid department at Cal State Fullerton. Um,
    you could also try the career center they might know mawr Thio about, like, possible
    grants and fellowships and scholarships that are available. You could talk to
    the department, Uh, in the psych department. We do offer various scholarships
    and fellowships that students can apply for. And when you know, based on what
    they're doing, they're not usually much. But often times, you know, you can you
    can get a bunch of them and, you know, all of a sudden it starts to add up. Thio
    pretty good chunk of change. Eso you. They're also government websites out there.
    I think in psychology the American Psychological Association, the A p A, um, has
    a list or something of possible, um, grants and fellowships and scholarships that
    are available, um, either through the A p a or through other organizations or
    association. So that might be another resource that you could check out. Um, but
    probably I would direct you first to the financial aid office of whatever school
    you're at right now, because they'll probably have a lot of information for you.

  transcript: Yes. So there are programs, and specifically we're talking here about
    PhD programs. Um, most masters level programs are you have to pay to go to them.
    Um, but if you're looking at PhD level programs, programs that focus on research,
    So not training people to be like clinical psychologist or counselors. Um, but
    just training them, training people to do research in the field of psychology
    programs like that. Often times not only don't charge you to go there as a student,
    but you actually get paid for the work that you're doing for the research work
    you're doing. So, for instance, you know tuition is often waved. Fees are often
    waved books and supplies or paid for um And then, in addition to that, the work
    that you are doing like as a research assistant, for instance, which is usually
    a part of the program, is you're working in a lab and you're contributing to the
    research. You actually get paid for doing that work on DSO. It's kind of like,
    you know, having a job while being in school, but your job is being in school

  transcript: there are actually quite a few programs available on campus for students,
    particularly those students who want to go on to graduate school, um in, for instance,
    research. So so for students who are interested in in research careers, there's
    a program called Maximizing Access to Research Careers or Mark for Short, um,
    that pairs students with mentors, faculty mentors and the students do research
    in the faculty mentors like under their supervision. Uh, they present projects.
    They go to conferences, they get help with grad school applications. Um, uh, G
    R E prep. Like all sorts of things, it's a great program. Um, students are actually
    paid to be in the program. So if you're admitted to the program, you do get a
    stipend as a student for doing that, and you get funds for the to support the
    research that you're doing. Um, there are is the McNair scholars, which is available
    thio students from a certain minority groups. Um, and that again is a mentor intensive
    program. So you're paired with a mentor. You get a lot of help with things like
    writing and time management, um, and resume prep and um, applications to grad
    school and things like that. Um, there are a whole bunch of programs. Sally Casanova,
    scholarships for students. Um, going into the biomedical fields. There are a lot
    of little like niche programs. So again, one of the places that I would recommend
    you go is the office of, like, Financial aid, um, or to the psychology department,
    um, they or even the career center. They should have information about all of
    the different kind of specialty programs on campus that air there to serve different
    groups of students based on either their backgrounds or based on their interests.

  transcript: the Jerry is kind of like the s a T for grad school. Um, so it z ah,
    higher level of, um questions and and knowledge assumed that compared to the S
    A. T, which is the college entrance, Uh, it's the same kind of stuff they're looking
    at just kind of your general linguistic abilities. Both, you know, writing, reading
    comprehension, all of that stuff. They're looking at your quantitative abilities
    eso, mathematics and science and things like that. Um And then oftentimes, there's
    a specialty exam that goes along with whatever domain you are wanting to study
    in during graduate school. So there's like a psychology Jerry test on a biology
    Jerry test. Eso you would take the one that's that's relevant. Thio your discipline.
    Um, and to do well on it, Honestly, it's one of those tests where you need I think
    the best thing you can do is learn how to take the test eso just like the S a
    T. There are certain rules with the jerry in terms of like, how much you're penalized
    for wrong answers. And so there are certain strategies. Um, for you know, if you're
    not sure about the answer to a question. Do you answer it or not? And it kind
    of depends on like how Maney answers you can narrow it down to. There's a lot
    of different test taking strategies for the G R E. Fortunately, there's also a
    lot of books on the G R E the that air relatively inexpensive or just available
    at the library. Um, and you can take a look at them and see the different test
    taking strategies. Oftentimes, they often have, like practice tests, they have
    practiced exercises that cover, you know, some of the more common information
    that regularly appears on the G R E. Um, they also have special books for, like
    the various subjects within the subject tests eso You can do a lot of prep for
    the G R E, but I would focus your prep on literally how to take the test as opposed
    to the information that's contained on the test

  transcript: How does a great question I'll be honest. I took the Jerry almost 30
    years ago and it was a very different test back then. It was, I mean, wasn't administered
    on computers. So, like your next question was not dependent on how you answered
    the current question. Um, and they also scored it differently. So there were some
    kind of guideline cutoffs when I was applying. So so each. There was a quant and,
    um and ah, the verbal part. So verbal and quant. And then there was your subject
    test. And so the verbal in the quiet and they also had a logic section. So the
    verbal in the quant that we're both worth 800 points and so combined the kind
    of general idea was that you needed to have at least 1000 to get into, like, a
    master's level graduate course and at least 1200 to get into a PhD level. Uh,
    course of study, um, and so but they score it differently now, so I'm not really
    sure, like what modern day scores like, how that equivalents to the older scores.
    And I don't even know if the cutoffs are still the same What I do know is that
    every program will list its average g R E score for, like, it's incoming classes.
    And so one of the things that you can dio is you can look around a different programs
    like Let's say that you're interested in industrial organizational psychology
    and you do a little research and you find, you know, maybe 20 schools that offer
    a degree, and you kind of look at their reputations and see how they how they
    are, Um, and then look at those schools and see what air their requirements for
    the G R E scores. And that's essentially what you want to shoot for is you want
    to shoot for the level that's required by the programs in schools that you are
    interested in. Um um, the other thing that I will say about the G R E scores is
    that a lo G R E score can definitely get your application like eliminated from
    the pool. And that's honestly, I think, the main purpose that they serve, um,
    this is an easy metric with which thio eliminate applications. So if you've got
    100 applications and you know you've only got 10 positions you want to find a
    way, thio easily go through those 100 applications and get rid of the applications
    that you just know you don't want. Um and so one way to do that is Thio use g
    r E cutoffs and G p a cut offs. And so those are the big two that are kind of
    used for that first cull of applications. So a lo g r E score can hurt you, but
    conversely Ah, hi. Really. Hi, Jerry. Score isn't necessarily going to help you.
    I mean, it may prevent you from getting eliminated, but this is not going to get
    you into graduate school. Like most people are not admitted to graduate school
    because they have amazing g r e scores. That's not what makes the decision. When
    it comes to the application, the application itself, the personal statement, the
    letters of recommendation usually count for more than a g r E score. But if you
    want to know, you know a number like I need this amount. My best advice to you
    is just to go to the schools and the programs that you're interested in, applying
    Thio and see what they're requiring

    is also much more independent than, um, when you're doing, like your bachelor's

    and a PhD or, like maybe another type of doctoral degree. So so that's kind of
    the two categories is a master's degree and a doctoral degree. So masters are
    usually either a master of arts degree or a master of science degree, depending
    on what course of study you're doing. And then there are multiple types of doctoral
    degrees so you can get a PhD, which is technically a doctorate in philosophy.
    Um, but that's really to distinguish it from an M D, which is a doctor of medicine.
    Uh, you can get a J D, which is a doctor of jurisprudence, um, an E D, which is
    a doctor of education, so there's a lot of different flavors of doctoral degrees.

    a prerequisite for this type of position is you have to have a PhD. Um, but they're
    not that many jobs that have those kinds of requirements. So graduate school really
    is an investment of both your money and your time s. So I think it's really important
    for students to kind of think about what it is they ultimately want to be doing
    and then do some research and find out if the people who are doing those things,
    what kind of degrees do they have? Because, you know, maybe you don't need a PhD.
    Maybe you just need a master's degree. Um, in which case, you probably be better
    off doing a Masters program instead of opting for a PhD

    So Emma stands for Master of Arts and M s stands for master of Science. And while
    sometimes there's some logic in this usually things that maybe you're in, like
    humanities or arts or music those were going to be M a degrees master of arts
    degrees. Whereas Degrees Master's degrees in, like, biology and chemistry, um
    are going to be masters of science degrees. Um, but sometimes it's kind of arbitrary.
    So, for instance, in our graduate program in the psychology department at Cal
    State Fullerton, we have both an M A and an M s degree. And so the M A degree
    is usually the track that's taken by people who want to do research, uh, maybe
    to work in a lab or maybe to go onto a PhD degree and then, you know, also be
    doing like, research or being an academics. Where is the M s degree is for people
    who want to go on to be clinicians, usually as like a license, marriage and family
    therapist. Um, so it's you know, in that case, you might think, well, the people
    who want to be scientists are getting a master of arts degree and the people who
    want to practice the art of clinical psychology. You're getting a master of science
    degree. So again it could be a little bit arbitrary. But that's really the difference
    is it's a master of arts or it's a master of science.

  transcript: So a PhD is in psychology, kind of the more traditional degree. So so,
    way back in the day, the doctors, uh, philosophers were kind of like the thinkers.
    And so a doctor of philosophy was was a degree that was earned by people who,
    uh, made their living thinking. Um and then there was the medical degree, and
    that was more of like, a practitioner type of degree. So these were people who
    made a career out of healing people or making people better. Um, and so the PhD
    was also very much a research based degree in psychology. Um, but clinical psychologists
    aren't spending their careers generally doing research. They're spending their
    careers, you know, practicing clinical psychology, which is you can kind of think
    of it in that sense, like an M. D. It's more like a healing degree. They're working
    with clients. Um, eso Assaidi reflects that Assaidi is really designed to teach
    up and coming clinical psychologist how to practice clinical psychology, whereas
    a PhD is still kind of designed in that traditional model where what you're doing
    is a lot of research and you're learning theory. And while that could be helpful
    for people who ultimately want to become clinical psychologist. Um, you know,
    Assaidi actually, in some ways is better training for them because they're actually
    learning how to practice clinical psychology just as medical doctors learn how
    to practice being doctors while earning their M D degree.

  transcript: So my advice to you in trying to kind of what you should look for in
    a graduate program graduate school is hard. It's not horrible. It's just hard.
    And so in my experience, unless you really love and are committed to what you're
    doing, you are not. You're not going to want to stay if because it's just it's
    so hard. Like, even if you really, really love it, it's still hard. So if you
    didn't really love it, it would just be awful, right? So I would look for graduate
    program, that is, you know, focused in an area that is very interesting to you.
    You don't want to devote your time and money to an area of research, for instance,
    that you are just not that interested in, um, make sure something you really want
    to dio, um the other thing is, you wanna look at the lab culture, so, you know,
    are the people who are working in that lab, are they the type of people that you
    like is the is the overall style of the lab, a style that you're comfortable with,
    Um, for the person who you're going to be working with, who's gonna be your mentor
    or they, you know, How do you communicate? How do they communicate? You know,
    do you jibe? Well, those are the types of things that you really do wanna look
    at because these are the people that you're gonna be working with for multiple
    years. And so you really do want to make sure that this is a good fit for you,
    not just in terms of what the lab is doing. So the research of the lab, but also
    just the lab culture itself.

  transcript: the length of graduate school depends primarily on what kind of program
    you're in, so a master's degree usually takes 2 to 3 years, whereas a PhD can
    take anywhere from four thio six, maybe even seven years. Um, in the PhD, What's
    really going to determine the length of the program is the type of research that
    you're engaged in. So if you are doing research where the studies, you know are
    accomplished really quickly, um, probably will not take you as long to finish
    your program. Whereas if you're in a field where you know a single study could
    take months, uh, up to a year, then it's probably going to take you longer to
    finish your degree.

    right program for you. Um, and having a good support network is really important
    to so, so kind of generating a support network, including, you know, some mentors
    that you could go to for advice on help along the way. All of those things can
    really increase your chances of success in graduate school, Yeah.

    like a master's degree, the content of the program. So are they teaching the things
    that you need toe learn. And for a PhD program, you want to look at content. But
    you also want to look at the research that's being accomplished in that program.

  transcript: generally to apply for graduate school, you're going to need to fill
    out an application form. Um, sometimes their general application forms that you
    fill out, and then you can send them to multiple schools. Sometimes schools have
    their own individual application form that you have to fill out just for them.
    Eso You can usually learn more about that on the school's website. They'll tell
    you exactly what you what form you need to fill out. You'll also need usually
    letters of recommendation at least 2 to 3. And so these air letters written by
    mentors people that you've worked with like former employers. Things like that.
    You know, they can be former professors, but you generally only want toe. Ask
    a professor if you have a close relationship with, um um, and then you'll need
    a statement of purpose. Often times, which is a brief essay, usually just a couple
    of pages, um, talking about you know why you want to go to grad school, why you
    want to go to this particular program on DSA? Mother details. Oftentimes again,
    the school's website will have guidance in terms of what they want you to cover
    in your personal statement on beer. Maybe a few other things that you need depending
    on the school that you're applying to. But those were the General three. That
    you'll probably need for all schools is the application, the letters of recommendation
    and the personal statement.

  transcript: so the best things the best way to improve your chances of getting into
    grad school are to have the right experience for the programs that you're applying
    Thio to have good letters of recommendation and toe have a very well crafted personal
    statement. So for the first one having the experience, this is why you want to
    do things like you wanna work with a faculty member. You want to do research,
    you want to get some practical experience in the field into which you are, you
    know, interested in pursuing a graduate degree because that is going to look really
    good on your application. Um, and it will distinguish you from people who you
    know don't have experience in the field. Um, you wanna have good letters of recommendation
    again? This is why it's really important to cultivate relationships with potential
    mentors with faculty members with employers, people who you can turn to later
    and ask for a positive strong letter of recommendation. And then finally, you
    want a well crafted personal statement. Eso you wanna make sure you've got really
    excellent writing skills and then you also want to take it and and have other
    people look at it and give you feedback on it. And so this is another place where
    mentors, uh, come, come in really handy is you could send them drafts and say,
    Hey, you know, how does this look to you? Do you have any suggestions for improvement?
    So I think that those are the things that will increase your chances the most
    of getting into graduate school.

    you can, um, physically go to the location and spend some time with, you know,
    for instance, the faculty, um, you know, in the department and the labs take a
    tour, meet the other graduate students and talk to them. Ask them lots of questions
    about, you know, what is it like being a graduate student in this program? Or
    what is it, like working in this particular lab or with this particular person
    and get a much information as you can and just be really, really try toe measure
    the vibe? You know, like, what is it like, Are these people very serious? Are
    they? Do they seem committed? Are they fun? Are they crazy? Like And it's not
    that, anyway, is wrong. What you're looking for is what works for you. What's
    the best fit for you? Um, and hands down there is nothing like being there. So
    if you can possibly go to the graduate school, um, I would strongly recommend
    doing that, and sometimes this is something that you can kind of bargain with.
    Like if somebody has made you an offer and wants a decision. You could say to
    them I would really like to come out there in person if you haven't already been.
    Um, And before I make a decision, and oftentimes they will offer to, you know,
    bring you out and and put you up while you're there at their expense, and I would
    definitely take advantage of that, if you can.

  transcript: Yeah, this could be really tough. Um, you know, sometimes it's really
    hard to tell. And I will say at the outset, graduate school is hard. There's a
    reason that not everyone is walking around with a graduate degree. It's because
    it's tough. And so I myself, even though now I look back on it and I really feel
    very fortunate that I went to the program, that I went thio, that I worked with
    the people that I worked with. Um, there were still times during that process
    or where I was like, I have made a huge mistake. I have. This is a disaster. I
    have totally gone down the wrong road here. So I think that, you know, having
    those moments of self doubt and and feeling like I made the wrong choice. That's
    very normal. Now, if you're feeling that way all the time for long periods of
    time, then yeah, you might want to pay attention to that and, you know, and that's
    where my second piece of advice comes in. Which is that if you have really determined
    that this is not the right place for you to be, stop walk away, quit and walk
    away. Do not stay and spend mawr of your time and money in a program where you
    are incredibly unhappy or don't feel that it is serving you. You are not doing
    anybody any favors by doing that, least of all yourself. But, you know, having
    those times of doubt, I think, is very normal in a process like graduate school,
    where it's just it's really tiring. It's very stressful. You know, you're gonna
    feel, really, you know, type stress out all the time, and it's very easy to feel
    like you've made the wrong choice. Um, you know, if you're feeling that way, take
    a break. See if you can take, like, a week off, or maybe just a couple days off
    to kind of catch your breath and sit for a second with yourself. And if you feel
    better than chances are, you're probably just kind of feeling really overstressed,
    Um, but if you don't feel better than that may be a sign that this is not the
    right path for you anymore.

  transcript: uh, that's a hard one. When you don't get into the program you want.
    Yeah, I think your best course of action is going to depend on a couple of things.
    Number one. Did you get into a different program? Maybe one that you didn't like
    as well. Um, if you did get into another program, let's say you got you didn't
    get your first or even your second choice. But maybe you got into your third choice
    program. You know, at that point, you know that the whole application process
    takes, you know, that's an effortful process. Um, and it may be that the third
    choice program is honestly good enough, you know? And if that's the case, then
    I would just go with the third choice and never look back. Um, if you didn't get
    into your first choice, you know, the one you were really hoping for and you didn't
    get into any other programs or you know, you on, Lee got into, like, maybe the
    safety schools that you really are not interested in going to. Um I would say
    at that point maybe find out why you weren't admitted. Sometimes it has nothing
    to do with you. Sometimes it has to do with funding. You know, the person that
    you wanted to work with just doesn't have the grant money to pay for another graduate
    student. Or, you know, the department just doesn't have money for more students
    or whatever. Um, so you know, if you can find out why you didn't get in and then
    if it's a weakness in your application, then take some time and address that and
    hit him up again. Mhm.

  transcript: so paying for graduate school or the cost of graduate school, I should
    say, is going to depend a little bit on the program that you go thio or the type
    of program. So if you're going to a master's program, generally you're going to
    have to pay tuition and you know, fees and books and things like that. Um, sometimes
    there are positions that are offered in master's programs for master's students
    in that program. So being an assistant to a professor, for instance, or working
    in a computer lab, you know, I would check with the department itself and see
    what graduate student positions are available to help you offset the cost of getting
    your degree, Um, for a PhD program. Oftentimes it depends on the type of program
    that you go to So in psychology, if you're going to go into a clinical psychology
    PhD program, oftentimes you're like a professional psychology PhD program. Oftentimes
    you are gonna have to pay for that out of your own pocket. It's kind of like medical
    school andan that case, you know, you could probably get grants or loans. Maybe,
    um, I wouldn't count on working sometimes with some of these programs, they're
    kind of built for the working professional. Um, but a lot of them, you really
    need to be a full time student and not just a regular, full time student, but
    a full time student in a PhD program, which is kind of like that's a lot of hours.
    It's not gonna leave you much time. Thio hold another job outside of being a student.
    So probably you're going to be looking at grants or loans at that point. Um, however,
    if you go into a research based PhD, oftentimes those programs are actually gonna
    pay you to be a student, because the work the work you're doing in terms of research
    is actually valuable work. Um, And so if you're working in someone's lab and doing
    research for them, they will pay you. You will get paid, um, either by them specifically
    by whoever you know lab you're working in or more likely through the department
    that that lab is located in, um and oftentimes also like tuition and fees might
    be waived. Um, eso So depending on the kind of graduate degree you're looking
    for, you may find that you don't have to pay for it or at least not pay for all
    of it s so it's definitely something that you should look into.

  transcript: Yeah, the cost of graduate school can vary widely, and it depends on
    a couple of things. It depends on what type of program you're going to. So, for
    instance, you know a master's program is generally going to cost less than a PhD
    program is going to cause, because it's just it's less time. Um, another factor
    that may influence that is whether there is there are employment opportunities
    like within the department. For instance, toe offset some of the costs of either
    tuition or books or living expenses or something like that. Um, some departments
    even offer stipends to their students, or they offer things like reduce costs,
    housing eso. There are a lot of things that are gonna affect kind of the overall
    total cost of going to graduate school. I would certainly recommend, um, contacting
    the graduate schools that you are interested in and seeing, or you know what things
    they offer to help offset the cost of attending graduate school. Because you may

  transcript: Yeah, it really depends. Some students don't take on any loans. Eso
    You know, some students who are going Teoh, a program that fully funds them and
    provides for low cost housing and stipends. And things like that may not have
    to take out any loans at all to go to graduate school. And so they will emerge
    from graduate school completely debt free. Other students do have to take out
    loans. Onda again. How much they have to take out in loans just really depends
    on a lot of different factors, you know, oftentimes, including where they're living
    in the country. So if you're going to graduate school in Kansas, for instance,
    your cost of living, just you know how much it costs to, like buy groceries or
    rent an apartment is probably going to be significantly less than if you were
    going to graduate school in Los Angeles, California. Um, so there's a lot of different
    factors that are gonna affect this. And so it's really hard to say that, you know,
    the average PhD student goes this much into debt because it's very individualized.
    Personally, I have a lot of friends that have gone, you know, they have Ph. D
    s. Andi. I know a couple of them who didn't incur any debt going through their
    PhD. I also know a couple of them that air literally to this day. Still paying
    off student loans. Eso it really just depends.

  transcript: This is an interesting question because I personally feel that the way
    you should evaluate a graduate program is maybe slightly different than the way
    that you would evaluate an undergraduate program. So when you're going to an undergraduate
    program, you know, oftentimes there are some schools that kind of have a reputation,
    like, you know, Ivy League schools. You know, saying I went to Harvard may mean
    Mawr than saying I went thio you know, San Diego State. Um, but when you're in
    graduate school, it's so much more of a personalized experience. And in my mind,
    what really matters is not so much the school that you went Thio, but who you
    worked with and what you did. Um, and the reason that I say this is that I know
    that the question that I get asked most frequently by professional people. So
    people who also, you know, have PhDs and or maybe in the research world, they
    don't say, Where did you go to graduate school? They say, Who did you work with
    in graduate school? That's what they want to know. It doesn't matter where I was.
    What they want to know is who I was working with. And so I think that, you know,
    really, that's where you want to put your focus is you wanna work with somebody
    who has a good reputation, somebody who's sciences strong or whose work is well
    respected. Um and I wouldn't worry is much about the actual context of where the
    work's occurring. So, you know, is that the University of Nebraska is that Yale
    that is less important compared to who are you actually working with?

  transcript: in general, The higher your g p a, the better your chances. This is
    one of those easy metrics that admission boards are going to use to essentially
    wade through a ton of applications like this is one of the first metrics they're
    going to use to just dump applications. Um, oftentimes, schools will tell you,
    you know, unless you have a G p a of 3.6, like, don't bother applying. So the
    the list their minimum g p a um and I would say for the most part, take that seriously.
    Like don't bother applying if their minimum g p a is 3.7 and you've got a 3.2.
    The chances that you're going thio your application is even gonna make it past
    the first round are probably pretty low. Um, the exceptions to this are if you
    have a personal connection somehow with the this program. So, for instance, if
    you or maybe working with someone right now and they have a colleague at this
    other unit at this other program at another university that you're interested
    in, um and they say, you know, I'll reach out personally to my colleague here
    and say, toe, Look out. You know, I'll give you a personal recommendation and
    say toe, look out for your application. And you know, I would also say that if
    that's the case, you want to address this head on in your personal statement?
    Why your GP a does not meet the minimum. So if there's a reason for it, you better

    I mean, you still might not make it, but, you know, you would definitely have
    a better chance at that point. Um, most schools are looking for a G p a of around
    3.6 or higher, so that's kind of what you're you're in that neighborhood. Um,
    if you if your GP is 3.6 or higher, you're probably good for most applications.

  transcript: Well, the first thing you want to do is you want to find out what g
    p a like What's the minimum G p A. That you need for the programs to what you
    want to apply. So most programs have a minimum. G p a on, but it may be something
    like 3.6. And so what that essentially means is that if you're G p A isn't 3.6,
    don't bother applying. Now they say that, but that's not necessarily true. So
    if your G p. A. Is less than whatever it is the school's you're applying to want,
    you have a couple of options. Um, if your GP is pretty close. So let's say the
    minimum G p A is 3.6, you have a 3.5. You might want to just take a few more classes
    and get a few mores and raise your G p A. That way. Um, I would only recommend
    that strategy if your overall G p. A. Is really, really close to whatever the
    cut office. Um, if it's farther from the cut off, then one of the things that
    you can do is you can take a look at your own transcripts and see, you know, why
    is your g p l o? Oftentimes the story is that, you know, sometimes usually it's
    early on in college, you know, maybe the second or third, or even first semester
    When you know people are still adjusting to being college students. They have
    a semester to where they don't do great in some classes, and so they may have
    some CS or DS. Or, you know, even if, um and those air really dragging down their
    overall G p A. Even if they recovered. And if you look at you know, the past couple
    of years, they've got nothing but straight A's. Those early bad grades are going
    to kind of drive down their overall G p A. Because it's a mean, um, so one of
    the things if that's the case that your in your overall GP is low. But maybe like
    your last, your most recent work is really, really good. Um, you can address that
    and most of the time on your transcript, for instance, it will calculate your
    overall G p A. But it will also just calculate your GP within your major so if
    your GP within your major is really high, then in that case, I would address that
    in your personal statement and say something like, You know, even though my overall
    GP is low, if you look at my transcripts, you can see that it was due to this,
    you know, one semester. And this is what was going on. You know, maybe there's
    a reason it was low that semester. Um, you know, But in the last two years, you
    can see that I've got a 4.0, average you know, in my major. And so that's kind
    of a sign that you've grown in the last couple of years. You've matured into a
    really good student. Another thing that you can dio is you can see if you can
    make a personal connection at this program. So this is where you're going to talk
    to your mentors. Um, talk to other people in your network and see if anybody knows
    anybody you know, at the program toe what you want to apply that you could maybe
    have a conversation with and say, Hey, you know, I'm really interested in your
    program. Here's my problem, you know, and Maybe they might have some advice for
    you. Or maybe they'll just say, you know, we'll keep an eye out from your application
    or something like that. Um, you may also wanna have your letter writers directly
    address this in their letters, so make them aware of this issue. I'm applying
    to a school, my overall GPS and high enough. But, you know, here's my GP for the
    last two years. It's much better. Could you specifically talk about this in my
    letter and say, You know what a good student I am and that kind of stuff and most
    letter writers, I mean, we want to write letters that are going to help you succeed.
    And so that information is totally fine to give to give to your letter writers.
    So, you know, those were some of your options. If your G p A is a little bit lower,
    then you know what you want it to be for. For applying Thio graduate schools

  transcript: I actually love the idea of a gap year. I'll be honest. Um, that really
    wasn't a thing. I think when I was going through graduate school, it was just
    kind of one thing after another. Also, I personally knew my own temperament, and
    I had a sneaking suspicion that if I stopped my educational journey that I would
    not restart it. Um and so I just did not allow myself to take any kind of break
    between any of my programs. So I went right from my bachelors degree, to my master's
    degree to my PhD, Um, but I do think that taking a gap year could be really beneficial,
    particularly if you use that time wisely. Um, so if you use that gap year to explore
    the field, like if you think you want Thio, you know, do clinical psychology with
    Children, and you use that gap year to like work with Children in some capacity
    to see if this is maybe a population that you are okay working with. That's a
    great use of a gap year. Um, I think you can use the Gap year to take some more
    classes or do some more independent study learn more about the field off psychology
    in the different areas within it, so that when you do apply to graduate school,
    you're making a much more informed choice that that you're and that's gonna help
    you really select graduate schools or programs that are going thio be beneficial
    to you. Um, so I like the idea of a gap here. I don't think that it discredits
    the student at all, particularly if they could say, like, this is what I like.
    You know, if you can kind of spin it as an intentional gap here, I think that
    actually looks very mature. So I think a gap here is a good idea if it's done
    correctly.

    that I made in graduate school are ones that are still sustaining me to this day.

    family related stuff. Um, I will say that the whole process has gotten a lot easier
    is my kids have gotten older? Um, but generally I would say it just kind of goes
    in season Sometimes, you know, some days are much more work intensive and less
    family intensive, and other days are more family intensive. One of the things
    that I will say that I think I truly believe has helped me is I made a very good
    choice in partner. So my husband, Brian, is a wonderful parent, and he's a great
    partner to me. We both have careers that we really enjoy, and we both really like
    our family. Um, but we split our responsibilities both to our own careers and

    all of them simultaneously. I kind of do one for a little while. And then I switch
    hats, and then I do another one, and then I switch hats, and then I do another
    one. Um, and you know, some things in my life have had to adjust that way. So,
    like, for instance, with friendships, I found that the friendships in my life
    that are enduring are the ones with people who understand that, you know, I'm
    not always going to be in contact, like sometimes weeks. They're gonna go by maybe
    even months, and you're not gonna hear from me, because I'm just I'm really busy.

    friendship. But, you know, other other friendships haven't worked out because
    the other person wanted a little bit too much more from me than I could give,

    to do is I like Thio set a timer for myself. Um, this is sometimes called the
    Pomodoro technique, and you can look up. You can look it up on Google. It's It's
    a very easy technique where you essentially have you write down a list, a list
    of tasks, and then you literally set a timer for yourself and you just say I'm
    going to get much done is I can, in this amount of time and the time could be
    whatever you want it to be. It could be an hour. It could be less. Um, but I usually
    set a timer for an hour, and I just say, I'm gonna work for an hour. I'm going
    to get us much as I could get done. And when the timer goes off, I'm going to
    take some time off. Um, and a Zoff. It is not. What I find is that by the time
    the timer goes off, I've kind of found my flow again, and I'm into what I'm doing
    and then I don't want to stop. Thank you.

    don't have a ton of time for just kind of like open ended conversations. But you

    if I can get a lecture done, then I can watch one of my favorite shows that night.

    excited to be learning the things that you're learning, it's really, really tough
    to stay motivated and see it through to the end. So I would definitely look at
    all of the available majors and choose one that really speaks to you. If you're
    not sure, you can always take an introductory class in that field and see if this
    is something that you like.

  transcript: It's pretty easy to get burned out if you're doing a lot at once. And
    so the way to avoid burnout is to pace yourself. Essentially be realistic about
    the time that you have available to you. And, you know, don't take too many courses.
    Try not to work more hours than you need Thio. Um, really pace yourself and take
    it slow. It's better to do that in the long run, because if you pace yourself,
    you're more likely to be successful in whatever it is that you're doing. Whereas
    if you try to take on a lot all at once, you're more likely Thio end up doing
    poorly, for instance, in your classes and then having to retake them. So it, even
    though it may seem like by pacing yourself, you're making your drawing the experience
    out. In the long run, you'll probably spend less time

    reasonable for them, especially if they have any other commitments, like family
    commitments or, you know, friends or things like that. So I think taking on too
    much not being realistic about your actual available time and energy and putting
    things off until, for instance, there do so I, for instance, have papers in my
    class, and I can't even tell you how many times students will turn in papers late

    that the way that you get better at it is you do it more so you practice more.

    One of my absolute favorites is the Purdue Owl. They have a lot of tips and tricks,
    some really great videos. Another resource to you, though, is your professors.
    Most of us air trained to write in AP style, and we can help you and give you
    style tips. My one piece of advice is that if you want a professor to look over
    like a paper or something like that, give them as much time as possible. So don't
    send it to them the day before it's due because chances are they just will not
    have the time to look over your paper and to give you help at that point. But
    if you can get it to them a week before it's dio, you're much more likely to get
    some advice from them.

  transcript: I'd like to think that I'm doing several things to support minority
    students. Um, one of the things that I think is really important for for my minority
    students is Thio know that they can approach me and they can ask me questions
    and that I'm a resource for them. Um, many of our students are first generation
    college students, so they're the first ones in their families to attend college.
    And they may not therefore have people at home advising them. You know how to
    interact with professors, for instance, and you know what's appropriate and what's
    not. And I think that they do tend toe air on the side of being super respectful
    to the point where they won't seek help. Um, or they feel uncomfortable sending
    me an email and saying like, I don't understand this. Can I meet with you on DSO?
    One of the things that I really try hard to dio is to emphasize multiple times
    throughout the semester with the students in my classes that if you have a question,
    if you're struggling, please come and see me. I would much rather that you come
    and see me with, you know, a question that maybe you know isn't appropriate. Rather
    than not ask the question. Um, so that's one of the things that I really try.
    Toe Try to dio, uh, to support my students, who are particularly first time college
    students. But in our demographics, those particular students tend overwhelmingly
    to be minority students s. So I think that that's one way that I'm. I work to
    help minority students. Another way is thio be involved in mentorship programs.
    I'm involved in one maximizing access to reach research careers that specifically
    targets, uh, minorities in in various fields on dso. I've been participating in
    that program for a number of years and have mentored students through that program.
    And also the McNerney near scholars is another program that I've worked with closely.
    Eso. So those air a couple of the ways that I've tried, um, Tiu really support
    specifically minority students

  transcript: that is such a great question. And there are. There are a lot of different
    answers to that. I have been on many search committees for faculty members through
    the course of my career, and I can testify to the fact that oftentimes when we
    get, you know, an application pools. So these are all the people who have submitted
    applications for particular position. Usually we have a very small component of
    applications from minority status individuals. Um, honestly, the majority of our
    applications are from white men. Andan. The next biggest group is white women
    and eso. I do think that that's one of the issues is that we just aren't getting
    the same number of applications from minority professionals, and that may probably
    be because there just aren't as many minority professionals. So when you look
    at you know who is who, who is getting a PhD, there are fewer minority individuals
    getting PhDs compared to white individuals. Eso that's one part of the problem.
    The other problem is that I don't think we have taken a strong enough stance,
    uh, in terms of specifically hiring minority individuals. Um, and I think that
    there are some politics that air revolving around that which aren't really necessary.
    But that has been a difficulty in our department. Um, you know, with issues being
    like, Well, is this the most qualified person? And it's like, Well, maybe not,
    because, honestly, we're just not getting the same pool of minority applicants.
    But representation is really important. We know this, and so is it worth it? Thio.
    Is it a better decision to hire a minority PhD who maybe doesn't have exactly
    the qualifications we're looking for, as opposed to hiring, You know, a white
    guy who does. And I think you can make a really strong argument that no, it's
    better to hire the minority person because they're bringing something to the table
    that the other applicant absolutely cannot bring.

  transcript: Well, I guess there are a lot of different ways you gonna answer this
    question? Um, on the face of it, I think you could argue that it's incredibly
    diverse because psychology is the study of people, you know. And we, you know,
    there are a lot of different types of people, and psychology is in the business
    of studying them all. Um, I think that in terms of the practice of psychology,
    um, and the profession of psychology, I think that we still have a long way to
    go in terms of diversity. Andi, I think that it's really important that we make
    that a priority. Um, because if we're looking at, you know, studying people, we
    need to make sure we're studying all different types of people on different types
    of cultures and how they navigate within those cultures. And and so I think that
    the field as a whole definitely has a long way to go. But I do think that there
    are concerted efforts being made. Thio have mawr diversity within the field of
    psychology

    And so I found a useful strategy in that case is to break that task down into
    much smaller items. And if I can just get a couple of those done, it really helps
    with my motivation to then continue on and tackle the rest of it. So that would
    be my advice is Thio break big things down into small pieces? Andi, just try to
    get a few of those pieces done like maybe every day or every week, Or, you know,

  transcript: so it it kind of depends on a couple of things. So So One main way to
    distinguish one group of professors from another is essentially whether they are
    tenure, track or not. Tenure track. So not tenure track professors or sometimes
    referred to as adjunct professors. And so they are sometimes also known as part
    time faculty. But that is kind of a misnomer, because oftentimes they're working
    full time hours, but they're not on the on the career path to getting tenure.
    Uh, tenure is a special state that essentially protects the academic freedoms
    of professors. Eso professors who are on the tenure track of their career are
    sometimes referred Thio as a full time faculty. Um, and within the tenure track,
    there are three different ranks of professors. There are assistant professors,
    which is usually what most professor start out with. So when you first get hired
    into a tenure track position, you are an assistant professor, and then you are
    promoted Thio, an associate professor, And that's about the same time that you're
    also promoted to having tenure. And then after that, you could be promoted to
    full professor, and that's kind of the last big promotion in the In the Professor
    world. Um, there's also additionally the rank of emeritus professor, which is
    given Thio professors that have, I think, technically retired, but they do occasionally
    teach classes.

    specific representation at all. So they don't have to represent equally by gender.
    They don't have Thio represent equally by ethnicity. Um, or anything like that.
    Um And one of the reasons for that is that, you know, depending on the question
    that you're asking you, you may not want Thio sample. You know, a very diverse
    population. You may want to be sampling a very targeted population. Um, I do know,
    however, that there are movements within psychology. Uh, for certain studies,
    Thio increase the diversity of their sample populations or their their sample
    the groups that they're gathering data from so and and this isn't just on ethnicity
    within ethnicity categories, but it's also within, for instance, gender categories.

  transcript: It's great. I love being a psychologist, although I do think when most
    people ask me that question, the what they're thinking about is that I am a clinical
    psychologist. So, like I'm a therapist or a counselor, and I am not that at all.
    Um, I am a research psychologist, and specifically I am a neuroscientist. So I
    study the brain and how it works on how it influences certain behaviors. But and
    I love my field. I love learning more about how the brain works and how it does
    all the amazing things that it does. Um, but I am definitely not a therapist.
    I they it's probably not a good idea to leave me alone with the people for too
    long. I'm not good with, um S O. I much prefer the research world.

  transcript: I think that being a clinical psychologists probably does require a
    certain degree of emotional regulation because you have to kind of be able thio
    interface with clients and not show like surprise or disgust. Um, but clinical
    psychology is really just one area of psychology. And so, you know, like the feel
    that I'm in research psychology. I mean, other than just general, you know, being
    in a social setting, levels of emotional regulation, it doesn't require anything
    more than that. So I think it really depends on what area of psychology you're
    talking about.

    Um, I think that you may want to go and talk, perhaps to a guidance counselor
    on day May may be in a better position to advise you with that.

  transcript: that is such a cool question. And the truth is, nobody really knows.
    Um, I think that the definition that I like best is the decision of whether something
    is normal or abnormal totally depends on the context. So it's kind of like the
    definition of a we'd like What's a weed? Well, a weed is a plant that's growing
    where you don't want it to grow, so it doesn't matter. The plant itself is immaterial.
    It's the context of the plant and so arose. Growing in a cornfield is a weed,
    and I think the same kind of applies to, you know, just general generalities about
    normal and abnormal things that are abnormal or things that are not appropriate
    in a given context. And that context may be very, very specific. So it's really
    hard to just say generally like This is abnormal. There aren't many things, if
    anything at all, that falls like into that heading

    a clinical therapist or a counselor, so I don't know what that career path actually

    And so to answer that question, you can find out mawr about both of those things.
    You can find out more about the field. A really good resource for that is the
    career center. They can help you learn all about this field and the various things
    that were going on within it and the kind of sub domains within the field. Um,
    and then you need to learn more about yourself and again. There's a lot of different
    ways you can go about that as well. You can work with a professional or you could
    just kind of do your own kind of self research. Um, but you're really the only

  transcript: that is a question for the ages and will probably never be answered
    because life is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I don't
    think there is one answer to that question. The important thing is that you find
    out what your answer to that question is.

  transcript: okay. Happiness is one of those things that's hard to define, but you
    know it when you feel it. Um, happiness is, I think, different for different people.
    So I don't think there is just one general definition of this is happiness. I
    think that really what we're all trying to do is figure out what happiness means
    to ourselves.

  transcript: dealing with anxiety can be really tough. Um, I do think that there
    are a few things that can benefit most people. One thing that I think can really
    help manage anxiety in the long run is to pay attention to what you are eating.
    Pay attention to what you're putting in your body. In particular, sugar really
    feeds anxiety. Um, and so you know, if you can limit the amount If you were gonna
    change your diet in one way, I would say that's the way to do it to limit your
    sugar intake. Um, other things that can really help Thio reduce anxiety are participating
    in physical exercise on a regular basis, and it doesn't have to be strenuous exercise.
    It could just be a very mild walk for, you know, 5 to 10 minutes. If you could
    do that every day, I think you'll be surprised how far that will go towards reducing
    your anxiety. Um, there are also other things that you could do, like breathing
    exercises and maybe meditation or yoga or something like that. Um, that that can
    really help Thio kind of control anxiety in the moment. Breathing exercises in
    particular, I think are very, uh um Good for for that kind of that immediate kind
    of reducing anxiety. Um, but yeah, there are a lot of things that are available
    to you to reduce anxiety. And honestly, I would just try everything you can think
    of and see what sticks, see what actually works for you.
