clintanderson_A1_1_1,Background,"My name is EMC Clint Anderson, that's Electrician's Mate Clinton Anderson. I was born in Los Angeles, California. I was raised there most of my life and I graduated from high school there. A couple of years after graduating from high school, then I joined the United States Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate for eight years. I served on an aircraft carrier. We went on many deployments. A deployment is when you go to war, you fight. We fought in the Iraq war. I went on three deployments and it was a really great time in my life. I had a lot of fun. At the end of the eight years, I decided that the Navy wasn't quite a career for me. So, I got out of the Navy. I started using the education benefits that we received and I started going to the University of California at Berkeley. I was majoring in computer science and afterwards, I started getting my master's degree from the University of Southern California. I also had a job at the Institute for Creative Technologies. It's been a lot of fun, this whole time. Thanks to the Navy.","Who are you and what do you do?

clintanderson_A7_1_1,Background,"So, I have a childhood that's pretty similar to many military people that I meet. When I was young, my parents divorced. My father, he was in the army. So I didn't see him that much. I lived with my mother for a long time. We moved from state to state. I lived in Washington for a while, I lived in Alabama for a while. Eventually, I moved back with my father instead of my mother, in California. So, I have actually seen a lot of America, thanks to their divorce. Eventually, I graduated from high school and after high school, me and my father we didn't really get along so I broke away from him and a couple of years afterwards I realized that I needed some kind of jobs help me with my finances, help me, you know find some kind of direction in life. So, that's when I joined the US Navy Reserve and the US Navy.","Tell me about your childhood.

clintanderson_A8_1_1,Background,"I had a great opportunity to know most of my family throughout my lifetime. My parents were divorced, so that means that I spent sometime with my mother's family, sometime with my father's family, sometime with my father's mother and sometimes with my mother's mother. So, I bounced around from household to household when I was a youth. I didn't really form any strong bonds with anyone but I did get an opportunity to see most of the world so I spent a couple years with my grandmother in Alabama. So, I got to shoot a few guns there and got to climb mountains and do all of that country stuff that, you know, a lot of people come into the Navy with. I just also lived in Michigan and it's kind of an impoverished area, if you have been watching movies and things, you probably know about this but it's developed my character in a lot of ways. Eventually, I finally moved to California and I have to say, out of all the places that I've been, which is all over America, California is the right place to be. It has a temperature that I want, the people and the diversity I want. So, maybe from now on I'll always stay in California.","Tell me about your family.

clintanderson_A9_1_1,Background,"In Michigan, it's the place that I stayed had a diverse amount of people but it was mostly crime ridden in some places. I've seen lots of things that you see on movies. For instance, drug use, some violence here and there. I've seen more graphic things like prostitution, homeless shelter and things like that. But those are things that I think maybe turned me into wanting to help my society a little bit more. Those are negative things. These are things that kind of pushed me to want to make the world a better place because I saw them. So, even though Michigan was, the part that I grew up in, Flint, isn't the, you know, ideal city, it is a good place to grow up and develop your character.","Can you tell me more about Michigan?

clintanderson_A10_1_1,"Background, Education","So, the type of student that I was in college, in high school and in elementary school, it varied. It was kind of like a sine wave. So, when I was in elementary school, I always took tests and they always said that I was like very very high achieving or something like that. I always scored really high on my IQs, so I got the impression that I was a really bright kid. In high school, it kind of dipped down. I was a little bit more independent. I stopped doing my homework. I stopped listening to teachers. I started hanging out with friends a lot more. So, my 4.0s and 3.8s started going down to you know, very very low. That's one of the reason that I didn't go to college right away. I think many people in the nuclear field like I'm in had a very similar story. I'd say more than half the people had that story. They were bright as kids but they kind of somehow lost their way, ended up going to community college and then going to the military or some other situation. So, going through the military actually helped me out a lot because it taught me a lot of self discipline, a lot of reasons to get motivated to study a lot. So, after I finished my active duty Navy career, I went back to college and I was on par. I started doing well with the smarts that I was given.","What kind of student were you?

clintanderson_A14_1_1,"Background, Travel","Besides Los Angeles, I've lived all up and down the coast of California. So, I grew up in Los Angeles that's where I graduated from high school at and then after I did my 8 year tour in the Navy, I went to college in the San Francisco area. My college was Berkeley which is right across the bay. During my Navy stint, they sent me to San Diego. So I've had maybe two or three years in all of those cities. Those are the major cities of California.","Besides LA, what other places in California have you lived in?

clintanderson_A15_1_1,"Background, Combat,Navy","During wartime, the tempo is a lot higher than it normally is. So, I fought in the Iraq war and then in the Afghanistan war and during those times we were in the middle of the ocean and days were pretty long from 6 AM to sometimes midnight very very often. We did so much training. It was a very trying time but is also rewarding because your patience is tested, your drive and your motivation is tested and eventually you fight the war and you do a lot of good things. So, it actually works out.","What was it like being in war? What did you do?

clintanderson_A16_1_1,"Combat, Risk,Navy","So, joining the military is a dangerous career. If you want to join the Navy but you're scared of going into battle, then there are obviously jobs for you but you have to inherently realize that being in the military is by definition a dangerous career. So, I was on a ship for the most of the time but they could have sent me anywhere. So, you have to be willing to accept that fact. However, even on the ship, there are dangers. For instance, you could be telling the ships where to go but they say that the top of the aircraft carrier is one of the most dangerous places that you can be, it's one of the most dangerous jobs. Additionally, once you're back home, you're with your family, you have a normal job but they could say, ""Hey, you know what? We need more people out there in the field."" So, they could just call you and you could be with the army people, with the marines people, fighting wars. But for the most part, the air force and the navy, they tend to have supporting roles to the army and the marines.","I want to join the Navy but I'm afraid of going into battle...

clintanderson_A17_1_1,"JobSpecific, STEM,Navy","So, my job as an EMC, Electrician's Mate is to fix pumps, to do preventive maintenance, to work on voltage regulators, to have lots of training as well. But the Navy also provides you with releases from your job. If you do the same job the whole entire time, you might get kind of frustrated, so I actually worked in the supply department which is where, for instance, there is the veins in the ship and there's like painting that needs to be done, there's lots of cleaning that has to be done. Some people work in the tech pubs library, which means that there's books for everybody on the ship that has to do their job. So you can work there for a while. So, basically for about six months to a year, you work in your main job and then they kind of give you a break even though you're on the same ship and then you have that cycle. So, you're always doing something different.","Though you were an Electrician's Mate, did you work on other things besides electronics?

Did you do different things in the Navy?"
clintanderson_A18_1_1,"Training,Navy","So, with the Navy, they always give you training. That's something that's going to be ingrained in your heart by the end of your Navy tour. So, the ways that they train you is that they have one of the people in your unit go up and provide something from a book that you probably learn in A school, that you probably learn on the job. So, for instance, the diagram of the reactor and we're supposed to know, for instance, all the valves that are there, we're supposed to know what to do in case of a casualty. For instance, if there's a fire in one of the pumps, we have to say, ""Well, you're supposed to turn off valve A, B and C"", and then call it in and then we'll tell the watch officer and then ask somebody to help and then go back and fight the fire. What happens if there is like, a radiation spill? Are you supposed to, you know, do these things? So, for instance, every time that you have a casualty, which means that there is a problem in the ship, be it a fire, a flood, a scram of the reactor, which means it breaks down, then you have to know what each of those steps are. And after being in the Navy for what, a year let's say, if you don't train about it, then you're going to forget it. So, they allow a little bit of forget and then they train on it so you remember it. Then, you have that cycle of training over and over and over.","What is the training progression and what is it like?

clintanderson_A20_1_1,"Background,Navy","I'm not an Officer. I'm a Chief, which is an E7 for the pay grade. The military is broken up into two portions, enlisted people who actually do the work and officers who basically manage. Now, the enlisted people, after a certain pay grade, E6 or E7, you start to supervise those enlisted people. Officers, from day one, they're automatically in charge of the whole unit.","Are you an officer?
Do you have a high rank?
Are you a Captain?
Are you in charge on the ship?
Do you have a leadership role?"
clintanderson_A21_1_1,"Education, JobSpecific, Military,Navy","I have a college degree and that allows me to apply to be an officer but not everybody who has that degree wants to go that route. So, to be an officer, you have to want to manage people, do lots of paperwork sometimes, to be in charge of the success or the failure of an entire unit and that carries a lot of responsibility. I'm an enlisted person and I do supervise the people that are underneath me. However, an officer's main goal is to become more and more important down the line. So, for instance, if you're a captain or even a commander, you could have 300-400 people underneath you and that's the main goal of most officers. For an enlisted person, you're more technically based. So, even though you have a small unit, that drive to want to lead people is slightly different.","You have a college degree, so why aren't you an officer?
Why aren't you an officer?
Shouldn't you be an officer?
Do you want to be an officer?
Do you get to be an officer if you're in the military a long time?
Why don't you want to be an officer?"
clintanderson_A22_1_1,"Jargon,Navy","So, the difference between an officer and enlisted member, they kind of meld together once you get higher in superiority but the real difference is when you start. An E1 or an E2 seaman or airman, basically their only goal, their only purpose in life is to do a technical job whereas an officer, an ensign, his day one is actually managing a group of people. Obviously, they're both training but the goal of what they're supposed to do is slightly different. As you get higher, as you get to become E5, 6 or 7 for enlisted or you become a lieutenant, that's an O3 for an officer, then you start going into management and supervising people. So, at least on the ship, you would see that the E7s, the Chiefs and O3s, the lieutenants are working side by side, pretty much doing the same thing but in the lower ranks, then enlisted is technical, officers are management.","What is the difference between an officer and an enlisted person?

clintanderson_A23_1_1,"JobSpecific,Navy","So, deployment life can be pretty hard sometimes. Most of the time you're working. I'd say about 75% of most days you're either going to work or coming from work or you know, sitting down preparing to go for work in a few hours. But, there is time to relax. So, many people, they join bands, they watch DVDs from the recreation center that we have there, they sit around and play cards, they kind of just sit and if it's later on at night, then you sleep, although like during the work day, you're not supposed to sleep at all. So, I remember my days would be, I would wake up at about 6:50, I would be in group, in formation at 7. It's only ten minutes I know, but you learn to be very very quick and then you're working until four o'clock. And from that point on, you could stand watch which would be another six hours after that, at least for me. Some people don't stand watch, some people do, its about half-half. Or you could be doing these trainings that come later on that night, they're called General Quarters. We were fighting a war, so they pretend like a bomb hit us or there's some kind of chemical spill or things that make you, that keep you on your feet to make sure that you have all the skills that you need to fight the casualty. So, short answer, you're working pretty much all day.","How do you spend most of your time on deployment?

clintanderson_A24_1_1,"Lifestyle, JobSpecific,Navy","During your off time, while you're deployed, you have a couple things that you can do. So, I remember, personally I would always go play poker and steal people's money even though you're not supposed to but we'd find some ways to, you know, have fun with each other. We would trade, like coke bottles or trade cigarettes. Some people smoked, I didn't, but I'd still, you know, like be in the middle of trading things for cards. I also watched a lot of DVDs. So, we had an MWR, a morale recreation and welfare program where you have a choice of maybe 200 or 300 DVDs. You just tell them that's the one that you want and then you can watch it on, if you have your own personal DVD player or a laptop. I'd also just go out there on the fantail and just watch the ships go by, you know, ships go by and jets go by and maybe for going along the coast, just look at the beautiful country that we're going beside.","What did you do during your off time while deployed?

clintanderson_A25_1_1,"Lifestyle, JobSpecific,Navy","So, when you're not deployed, life is actually pretty good. So, the military comes in waves. Our hard time is when we go on deployment. That's when you give it your all, that's when you're working the hardest but when you come back then they kind of go easy on you. So, well actually, I was living in San Diego. This is an example from when I was down there and our days were pretty early so that we fight the rush hour traffic. I think they began at six and then noon, that's when we normally have our lunch but they just send us home. So, days are cut short at six hours and so you just like, actually it's five hours because the traffic is the thing that cuts most of the morning. So, days are from seven to noon and then you split and go home and go see your family. So, you have a lot more time sometimes when you get off deployment.","How do you spend most of your time off deployment?

How is work different off deployment?"
clintanderson_A26_1_1,"JobSpecific,Navy","The work that I tend to do on a typical day actually depends on whether I'm deployed or not deployed. So, on deployment, then you pretty much are working the whole day and it's broken up into chunks. The first part of the day is just getting together, talking about how the rest of the day is going to be, do work orders. We write about the things that we should be doing for, maybe the next week or the next couple of hours or something like that. So the next chunk is we actually go and perform the work. So that's about another three or four hours. The next chunk is we get back and we start doing training, so we make sure that we're ready for casualties that happen, if there's a fire, if there's a flood. Then that's about the time that you get off work and you have a couple of hours just to kind of relax and hang out but later on at night, then you do this thing called General Quarters which means that you come back and the whole ship pretends like there is a big casualty happened to the entire ship. So your days can go into the night. When you are not deployed and you're stationed, you know, stateside, then your days are a lot easier. You have one part of, you know, training what we want to do later on. You have another part of training where you just open up a book and review some electronics or nuclear power things and then you have a small part where you are just doing preventive maintenance, which means that you're working on a pump, make sure that's fine, opening up regulators, making sure you know, nothing's inside and putting new equipment on the ship.","Describe the work you do on a typical day.

clintanderson_A27_1_1,"Background, Lifestyle","Now that I'm not in the active duty Navy, I joined the US Navy Reserves and I've been there for about the last eight years. So, that job isn't extremely difficult. They say that it's two days per month, two weeks per year and I've actually worked a lot more than that but it's a minimal time in the military. So, I've had a lot of time to do whatever I wanted to. I've split it between working at jobs. For instance, my job is, I'm a Japanese teacher in Japan but also work for the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies and I find little pieces of jobs here and there. So, I'm a part of a start-up. A computer science start-up working with virtual reality. I also go to school. So, I'm a full-time master's student when I'm back in America and I am studying game development.","What are you doing now that you aren't active duty Navy?

clintanderson_A28_1_1,"Money,Navy","So, your paycheck is one of the biggest things that people really love about working for the military. Right now, I'm a Chief, so I make about $4500 per month. Well, I don't make it, I am in the US Navy Reserve but usually on active duty, Chiefs make $4500 per month and they also have this thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing which almost doubles your paycheck. So, you get about like $2500 per month and if you add that up it's about $75000 per year.","How much do you earn working for the Navy?

clintanderson_A29_1_1,"JobSpecific,Navy","The amount of hours that you work in a typical day actually depend on whether you're deployed or not. So, if you're deployed fighting the war, then I'd say 12 hours would probably be the average. On some days you get away with working only eight, that's including Saturdays. Many days, in fact every four days, you're working for a day and a half. So, you stand your eight hours of normal work and then you have your General Quarters, which is actually training at night time for two or three or four hours and then you could have another watch from midnight until six the next day and you could possibly have your normal work day tacked on the end of that. So, you know, some days, if you're really in it, you're working, you know, a day and a half to two. Sundays were my easiest days where I'd only work for six hours and that's like a great day for me. When you are not deployed, then days are a lot easier. You probably get to work around seven and then you leave around noon so that means your days are only five hours or six hours.","How many hours do you work in a typical day?

clintanderson_A30_1_1,"JobSpecific, STEM,Navy","Problems show up every now and then. When you're on active duty, so it kind of depends on whether you're deployed or not. If you're deployed, that means things happen, you know, with any mechanical equipment. So, pumps could break in the middle of the night and then you get waken up and, you know, you have to go fix it. Sometimes you have people that come in drunk, on the weekends and when we were in port, so you'd have to make sure that, like, to get to their bed safely and that they get disciplined later on. Things like that happen on deployment. When you are not deployed, then you still hear the drunk people coming in, you know, but because you're not, the ship isn't being used over and over and over every single day in and out, problems with the equipment doesn't happen as much. So, you just do preventive maintenance, which means that even though this pump looks fine, you're just going to open it up and check to make sure that the oil is there, and you know, that is at the right temperature and shut it. So, a lot easier time.","What types of problems do you deal with on a daily basis?

clintanderson_A31_1_1,"Lifestyle, Culture,Navy","So, you probably heard of the term 'drunken sailors' and that's for a good reason. Once you are deployed and you pull into a port, which is like a little city of a new country, then the people are very very antsy and they want to get out and, you know, party a little bit. So, you probably been on the ship, in the middle of the ocean, you haven't seen another, you know, non-military soul for about a month. So, they really want to go out there and, you know, like, you know, do the opposite of what they were doing which is being disciplined. Now, they want to, you know, go be young kids. The military's basically eighteen to twenty four year olds. So, kind of like the college life. So, they go out there and do college level things. They find the first bar, they sit with each other and just, you know, find, you know, the cheapest alcohol and you could find them there the whole entire day and then they come back to the ship. The military knows this, so they have people walking around, checking into the bars, making sure they aren't caught causing fights, which they are, make sure that people aren't, you know, drinking too much which they are, make sure that people can make it home safely, you know, which means that they come back by taxi, which means that they come in handcuffs sometimes but it's all in good fun. By the time we leave, out of five thousand people or sometimes eight thousand people that are there, you only have maybe one or two that actually get into real big trouble. I personally didn't, I personally wasn't involved in that drunk culture so much. I actually liked to go out to the town and explore, you know, the museums and the scenery and things like that but I had a few drinks myself too.","What kind of issues are there with alcohol in the Navy?

So, the Navy takes some strides to kind of change this. We get lots of training. We get, for instance, when we go to ports, when we're on deployment, we have this thing called the 'buddy system', which means that you're not allowed to go out yourself. You actually have to tap one of your friends and the both of you go out to explore this new city. They want to make sure that you don't go out there and get yourself into trouble by drinking too much alcohol and then having a stranger, you know, guide you back to the ship. There are people who would rob you, there are people who will, you know, do harm to you. So, the 'buddy system' is probably the Navy's biggest way to combat alcohol misuse.","What is the Navy doing to combat heavy alcohol use?

So, you know, there are people who are very motivated and want to become the Master Chief of the Navy. You have some people who, maybe were criminals before and joined the military to prevent going to jail, to be given a shot for normal life before they winded up in a bad place. So, you have the whole gamut of people and different career paths, different intelligence, different motivations for being in the military. So, in general, people of a similar quality tend to hang out with the same people. So, people who like to drink all the time, you'll find that they're, you know, have this one house that they always go to, over and over. People that are very very motivated study all the time. You'll find that they probably share a house with people who want to become an officer. So, you also find that that's very apparent in the ports that you go to. So, for me, I didn't want to. I wasn't a drinker at that time. Not, not very much. So I'd go into port and I try to tap people like, ""Hey, do you want to go see some place fun?"", ""Do you want to go climb a mountain or visit a castle? So, once we do that, then there's very limited chance of, that we'd find problems. Some of the people who, like, are really, you know, really eager to have fun, the very first place that they go to is the bar and people similar to them are there and you can get lots of people like that, then probably, you can find yourself into trouble. So, as long as you're aware of that, as long as you're not somebody that drinks all the time and you know, wants to get me in trouble who's just trying to, like, visit ports and once I'm, even though I don't want to drink all the time, I have to realize that if I visit people that are drinking all the time, then I might get in trouble as well.

I knew I was smart but I just didn't have enough time to, you know, pay my bills at the time. So, I joined the military and one of their promises, they said that you could have a really high paying job at the end of your career. You know, it's a six year contract. So, I said, ""Okay, well I have these skills"". They taught me math, they taught me physics, thermodynamics, chemistry and by the end of my six year tour, I had enough knowledge to basically become Homer Simpson. I could go out there and work at a nuclear power plant, full of confidence. So, they give you the skills that you need to get a really high paying job or a different job.

If you wanted to stay in the same field, then you could. So, for instance, the aircraft mechanics. Yes, they were fixing jets and they were working on jets. So, there aren't that many jets that they could work on outside but Boeing is eager to hire those people. You can see how jets and 747s kind of, are the same thing. So, you can find something in your field. For me, personally I didn't actually like my field completely, enough to make a full career out of it. So, I changed. Instead of Electrician's Mate, I became a computer scientist which is something completely different but, all of the basic skills that I received, the math, the physics, the thinking logically about things, they still apply to my computer science.","What do most people do after leaving active duty?

Along with those long working hours, you're away from your family. That's a part of, having those long working hours. So, for instance, deployment is probably everyone's major reason for getting out.

I take drives to Las Vegas, because it's kind of close to Los Angeles and I also still get to travel a lot because of the US Navy Reserve. So, in the US Navy Reserve, they send you to the four corners of America. We go to New Hampshire, to  Virginia, also to Washington and San Diego. So, pretty much every year, they actually send me there. They give you a free car and a free hotel, so it's kind of like, a little mini travel.

Making sure that the ship can run, make sure that the officer can fly a jet, making sure that that jet is fixed and that pilot knows his information, make sure that he can drop this bomb, making sure that bomb drops, make sure that the battle is won, making sure that the battle is won, make sure the war is won.

I'm an E7, so my responsibility is to know how this unit can help the civilians, make sure that this aircraft carrier runs fine and I think as officers, the higher you get, if you're a captain, you make sure that this aircraft carrier fits in this realm of the region so that, like we have power over there, we can dominate our foes.

So, it's not a nine to five job normally. When I was active duty and I wasn't on deployment and I was just stationed at my command, you still work many many cases during night time.

A Chief will come in and say, ""Okay you're on pumps today, you're on valves today, you're fixing the drains today, you're in the bilge today."" Chiefs are the ones who actually tell people what to do. So, they don't need to be told what it is they're supposed to be doing because they only have one job, which is to hand out the work.

So, for instance, an O1, O2, O3, they're told by the higher level people who they're supposed to be managing, ""You're supposed to be tagging along with these people"", or I think for Officers, their main goal is just to be, to train themselves.

So, they gave all of these positives to join the nuclear field and I got to admit, that actually overshadowed any other job that I wanted to pursue. In A school, you learn, basically graduate level nuclear work, nuclear studies. So, I'd been in college and I went to master's courses and I got to admit, the military is actually more intense than college, than any college that I'd been to. They work you for eight hours per day, they give you lots of tests and it's simple, they always say that nuclear field is as hard as a pre-calc or I'm sorry, a pre-algebra class and that's actually true.

The difference is, everybody that goes through this training, by the end, for the nuclear field at least, they know exactly what you're going to do, how to do the nuclear training that they've been shown and if you can't, then you have to do something else.

I graduated high school and I wasn't the best high school grad, you know, many people in the military aren't and I tried college for a while and I was very, an on and off again student. I got a few Fs when I was there and because I was working two jobs at the time and you know, my days were pretty full. So, the military actually allowed me to have a semi-regular life, you know, like a semi-regular life. Because I was taking care myself, because I didn't have the support of my family, the military welcomed me with a job, a place to stay, some cash in my pocket, a skill set and that pretty much, once I got that grounding, then I was able to be very independent, very self sustaining for a long time. So, it's kind of, it took care of me in that way. So, do I love the military? You could say that I do. You know, it's the thing that allowed me to have a college education later on, it's the thing that allowed me to save up so much money and I think I'm doing pretty well for someone my age, so. As far as my job, my job as an Electrician's Mate, I didn't, it's not the job that I really wanted to do at the beginning. I wanted to learn languages and you know, travel the world a lot and I'm a nuclear technician.

And, I wasn't a very good engineer. I didn't have the engineering mindset when I joined the military at first. However, I grew to love my job because the training that they give you, they make you a real expert at it. So, once you find a job that you can do, you start doing well and then you start getting awards, you start learning more things on your own and eventually I said, ""You know what?

You can drive down any street and if you see a picture for the military, you might see someone in these, in this uniform, but in a very very movie style picture. And it's not always like that. For the most part, we're not soldiers. I'm not a soldier, I'm a sailor which is different than what many people think of the military.

So, if you want to be the soldier that you hear about in the movies, then you join the Marines. They work out a lot more, they're the first people that start to fight the war. You have to, you know, be pretty strong and pretty brave, in the other branches too but more so for the Marines. If you want to be similar to the Marines but you want the tough lifestyle, you want the, you know, the rough, rugged fighting but you're more mechanically oriented, then you can try the Army. So, the Army, that's when you drive in tanks, that's when you set up communication systems in the middle of the desert. So, they're kind of Marines but they're not the first ones out there. If you want a, kind of, more civilian style job, then you join the Air Force. Air Force is known that you, it's known that you have some of the best equipment. For instance, at Travis Air Force Base, they have excellent golf clubs. They have, you have basically, a nine to five job. You can, kind of, sit in office many times. It's not always that case. You know, you can find lots of different jobs in any service but this is what was going on in my mind in the second year that I was in the Navy. So, the Navy is different from all of those. So, for instance, when you're on deployment, when you're six months, when you're traveling around in the middle of the ocean for six months, it's not like you're working out every day, also it's not a nine to five job in an office because you're working pretty much like, the whole day, you know, and it's not in an air conditioned office. It's sometimes down in the middle of the plants. The thing that the Navy has going for it is that you should be very technical. You should know your job better than any of your civilian counterparts.

So, I got to visit the four corners of America and I got to see the different lifestyles. So, I grew up in Alabama which is, like, down south in a black community. Everybody around me, my neighbors, everyone was black and then, you know, you go to school that's mixed but I got to see that. I grew up some of my time in Flint, Michigan which is a very urban place but it's on the poorer side. So, that glove part, you know, I know all about that. And when I joined the military, then my first school was in Charleston, South Carolina which is another down south place but I got to see, you know, it's little bit more mixed. Then I went up to New York, Albany which is nice green country and I got to visit 'The New York City', you know, very often so that was really cool for me, to visit such a famous place. Later on, I got stationed in San Diego and it's super hot, well, it's good temperature, it can be very hot as opposed to New York which was freezing cold and it's a very big city. You know, it's my style of, I'm not a country backwards boy, you know, like, climbing mountains and hunting. I am a city guy myself. So, I got to see San Diego which is, like, I'm from California originally so that's up my tree. And then, I finally got to visit Bremerton, Washington which is in the middle of Washington state and it's kind of country, you can own bigger houses there, you know, for much cheaper. So, it's much less expensive than California and I knew a lot of people who used to be Californians but then they, you know, changed over to Washington because the life is a lot easier. They liked having a five bedroom house with a big green yard for the kids to play in and nice and quiet neighborhoods, you know, so, a lot of people change. So, I got to see all those and eventually, I realized out of all the places that I visited in America, I'm a California guy.","Where did you have to move in your career, and how did that change things each time?

clintanderson_A81_2_1,"Culture, STEM,Navy","My career field is very very unique. From what I understand, 60% of the nuclear technicians out there in the world come from the Navy. So, I'm a nuclear technician. I don't think that I would have had his training had I not joined the military itself. So, being a nuke is very very specific. You know, there aren't that many places that have it, the nuclear power plants up along the edges of America and there are the subs in the ships of the United States Navy. So, that's very unique in itself.","What do you find unique about your career field?

Why is your job special?"
clintanderson_A82_2_1,"Fit, STEM, Growth/learning,Navy","Are great practitioners of this field made or born? I would say that it's a little bit of both. Now, there's some psychology here. I do believe that when you're born, you have certain innate abilities, comes from your mom and your dad, comes from your race. Some of us are different skinned, some of us are taller or shorter, some of us are, you know, stronger based on your genes and I also think that, like, your mind is, it follows the same trait, you know, like everybody's different. Some people are artists when they're born, some people are engineers when they're born. However it depends on how you grow up. So, you can take someone who's an artist as a kid and then you can train them through their lives to become a great engineer. Now, maybe they might not be the best engineer because it's not in their bodies but they can do a good job, a great job in fact. So, it's a combination of both. It depends on who your mom and your dad were. Hopefully, you got that training, whatever training that you want to be and later on in your life but if you don't, the military, who realizes this, can train anybody to do anything. So, some people will have to do a lot more work to achieve their goals. Some people can, for instance, join the nuclear field like I am and it can be a breeze for them. Some people might have to put in the work, but regardless of that fact, they can take anybody, whether you're an expert from birth or whether you need to put some time in it and they'll make sure that you do the pipeline so that you can do the job well.","Are great practitioners in this field made or born?

clintanderson_A83_2_1,"Priorities, STEM, Advice,Navy","Some of the priorities that I would suggest for someone entering the field, well, me personally, once I found out that I was going to become a nuke, become a nuclear technician, I guess I wasn't going to, for about seven months or eight months, so I took some community college classes to, kind of, brush up on some of the physics, some of the math and I have to tell you, that was a very big benefit. I didn't know anything about physics, like, for instance, I didn't know like, what happened with gravity and shooting bullets and stuff and some common things that I would have gotten wrong but because I took those college classes, that helped me prepare myself better to do well in A school. Because I did well in A school that, you know, like, set me off on a big career path later on. But it's not just like, nuclear technician, it could be, for instance, electronics technician. You might want to brush up on some of your voltage and your current and your resistors. You could be a cook. You might want to brush up on, like, the different specialties of the flavors that you're going to be using or you know, ask some other cooks out there, like, ""What does it take to be good at my job?"" So, just kind of understand the field that you're going into and try to learn about as much of it as you can beforehand.","What priorities would you recommend for a person entering this field?

clintanderson_A84_2_1,"JobSpecific, Management,Navy","So, the fairness in the Navy, it, I have to say that the military is fair. However, they have some intricacies that I have to say. So, for instance, let's say the economy does poorly. Then the President is to blame. Now, no one's going to say, well, ""You know, President, you are the one that caused that entire city to be downgraded."" It wasn't his job, you know, like, maybe it's the President before him. However, he takes responsibility for it. So, there's a lot of responsibility taking for things that you don't directly control but because it was under your guidance, you are the one that, who people look to, whether it was your fault or not. So, if for instance, my military unit has many people that aren't physically fit, then they're going to say, ""Chief, what is wrong with your unit?"" Now, I don't have any excuse. I could say, well, ""You know, I tell them to work out and they just don't listen."" I could grab them by the collar and like, try to run with them but in the end, the people that are working for you, it's their, it's under their cognizance and you just take responsibility for it. So, is that fair? In many cases, you might not think that it is fair but that's the system that we play by and as long as you're familiar with those rules, then that kind of motivates you to be more involved in the things that you're supervising, to make sure that they go right.","How fair are the expectations of you as an employee?

clintanderson_A85_2_1,"JobSpecific, Failure,Navy","If you try your best or you follow the directions as good as you can, then you have my word, you have nothing to worry about. If something goes wrong, for instance, like, let's say that there's a piece of equipment that doesn't work the right way and you can't complete your mission, then, of course, they might say, ""You know what, like, you should have done more preventive maintenance on it or you should have looked at it better"", but no one's going to fault you for that. If for instance, something else goes wrong that you tried your best to complete and for some reason, it doesn't work out the way that you expect, then you might get talked to, you might get, you know, because the responsibility is there, someone has to blame someone and it could be you but you won't get punished for it, which is something that I'm very proud about for the Navy. They're not going to bash people for doing quality work.","How accepting of failure is this work environment when a good and honest effort was made?
If you screw up, but worked hard, do you get another chance?
Is failure, even if it is not your fault, held against you?

clintanderson_A86_2_1,"Growth/learning, STEM, JobSpecific,Navy","So when you come into the military from day one you are provided with many opportunities to grow and expand yourself. So, even in boot camp, some of the tasks that they provide for you, that they ask you to do are kind of complex. So some people, let's say they were really good in high school. It can be very easy for them, they understand the math that's involved, they understand how how the physics works, how to tie the knot. But for some people it could be the first time that they've ever seen it in their lives. Maybe they've never even been on a ship before you know so be a lot harder for them. So, the cool thing about the navy is that it gives you all the resources that you need, hands down. So if you don't need it then you probably won't use it but if you do need it then it's all a matter of asking a chief ""Hey where can I get help"" or a matter of going to your local library and getting that book. The biggest thing is that there's gonna be someone to your left and someone to your right that can work with you hand in hand to make sure that you complete your job. But what the Navy doesn't want is someone who can't do their job who is trying to do their job because that's gonna get someone killed. So they make sure that whether it's tying a knot or painting a ship or it's going down and fixing the pump they're gonna make sure that you can complete your job and if there's any question to it then they're not gonna allow you to do it so.","What range of tasks and opportunities does this field present to allow me to grow?
Can I move up?

clintanderson_A87_2_1,"Management,Navy","The bosses that I've had in the navy have been varied. Some of them I've got along with greatly but others they- in many cases it it depends on the type of personality that they have and just like with anyone, somtimes you make friends sometimes you make enemies if you can say that. So most people are just somewhere in the middle so the people that you would have a beer with in real life, those the people you can joke around with, those are the people that understand your personality and they're the ones who respect your work the best. However I gotta say that many people think that the military can be political, so for instance you could have a work center that has like four or five people and then you can have a supervisor for them and you can see that the supervisor has a better communication with you know two or three people in the unit. So the quiet person who barely ever talks to that supervisor could get frustrated in the fact that his work isn't being recognized the way that it should. So I've had that personal problem too. But it is what it is. You just take an average of your whole entire career. Sometimes you will be a superstar and sometimes you are gonna be kinda like the bottom of the list. But for the most part as long as you you present a good effort then you'll be successful. I made it to chief, so it seems like most of what I've been doing with my bosses has been on the positive side.","How satisfied have you been with your bosses in your career?

clintanderson_A88_2_1,"STEM, JobSpecific,Navy","So some of the technology that I worked on in my career as a nuclear technician, it's kind of divided into two parts because the nuclear technology field is divided into two parts. The first one is electrical things, I'm an Electrician's Mate, so I used many components like a watt meter, a volt meter, oscilloscope these are all equipment that you use to touch things around the plant to get readings on them. See what their oil level is, see what they're voltage is, see what the current is, see what the power is. So they're really used all throughout America as electricians as use them. The other part of my job, the nuclear technology field, is very specific most of the time. But if you think of Homer Simpson, he was a nuclear technologist. It only deals with things that the uranium cycle can do to make power. So some of things that I worked on deal with the nuclear part of the aircraft carrier and the way that it makes the ship run. So for instance it makes electricity. So for instance I worked with turbine generators. The nuclear technology of the aircraft carrier makes steam, so the steam will power lots of different things all around the ship. So all of the valves that it takes to make sure that the steam goes to the right places, so that a spin pumps, or to move the screws of the aircraft carrier so that it can move through the water. All of those are things I dealt with as far as technology.","Describe the technological environment in which you've worked.
What is the technology around you every day?
Do you work with a lot of technical equipment?
Do you work with fancy gear or just regular tools?
Do you work in a lab or on-site?"
clintanderson_A89_2_1,"STEM, Future","With nuclear energy, maybe because I have a bias because I went through the program but what's really pushed upon us is that it's very safe. It's one of the safest ways to make energy that we have. Now there is a concern about nuclear waste and of course you know we have nuclear waste at the end of an aircraft carrier's life cycle, but it's controlled in a certain spot and we put in the middle of the ground as opposed so let's say charcoal which produces fumes in the air as opposed to sunlight which doesn't provide the energy for the surface area that it has , to produce as much as the nuclear power that is. As opposed to wind which requires these big things in far off places. So nuclear technology can be built anywhere in a safe manner, and in fact the navy has a history of zero incidents of nuclear failures in the navy's history, so we're really proud of that. I think that nuclear technology should be the way to go for our future energy needs; however, I do understand people's hesitation with taking on nuclear power, especially with the thing that happened in Japan-the great Japanese earthquake in 2001. So it's been a big problem to try to pick up all of the all the pieces there. They still have problems with it, even though it has been you know like eight years later. However that took a huge natural disaster to cause a problem that day, so whether it's charcoal whether it's sunlight you know no matter what, when you have a big earthquake like that then that is going to happen but otherwise nuclear power is one of the safest ways to make energy that I know of, and that's what we are taught.","What is your opinion on nuclear energy and its future?

clintanderson_A90_2_1,"Culture,Navy","The organizations most helpful to me number one has to be the military healthcare system so I think I hurt my thumb I also sprained my foot really bad and one thing that you don't really have to worry about being in the military is the top of this head to the bottom of your feet- it's all taken care of. You might have to pay a little bit more for your family but other than that the rates are really cheap and it's very convenient. Another thing that I think of, another association I think of when I think of the military that is actually on the fun level is MWR. Without MWR I would have a hugely different impression of the military but they throughout my whole entire career if I ever wanted to play pool, if I ever wanted to bowl, if I ever wanted to go hiking, skiing, camping, they were right there with super friendly people to make sure that our work outside of our hard military life is rewarded. And finally I have to give my credit to the USO. Whenever I go to an aircraft carrier they're the nicest sweetest people. They give me hot dogs, cakes, cookies, they provide me a place to sleep, they allow me to put my bags down, especially when I want to walk around the aircraft carrier without being over burdened. I see other people out there waiting in these long lines, back up against the wall with the kids and then I see the USO people and their military families having the time of their lives even though it's a five hour flight. So hats off to USO.","What organizations were most helpful to you in your career?

That's basically the military's leisure association, you go in there you can ask them anything from hiking equipment, camping equipment, maybe they can show you a place to shoot guns. If you're in a foreign country they can tell you all the different places around that you can enjoy yourself. So for instance in San Diego, they told us where Disneyland is, Seaworld, how to go to Mexico safely, how to go to Las Vegas, all the things that are around San Diego. They also give you cheaper rates than civilians can get. So basically if you're in any place that has MWR that's the first place to go when you want to try to do something fun out in the community.","What is MWR?

They come and they volunteer their time to show their respect to the military in lots of ways. The way that I know is that they're at airports and they have a little building off to the side or maybe they're on the second level of the airport where you can go in and you can rest, you can eat some of their food, you can have conversations with other people on similar flights, and it's really convenient. I'm sure that they do other things as well so I wanna give them credit for that but the way that I know them is from their support at the airports.","What is USO?

clintanderson_A93_2_1,"Risk, JobSpecific,Navy","You might want to try to develop yourself into the best sailor that you can be, and when you do that, when you want to try to do that, that means that you have to take on jobs that aren't usually easy. So it all began when I joined the join the military. At first I had the opportunity to take normal jobs, slightly higher jobs, and in their most advanced field, nuclear technology. So that's what I chose to do. I didn't take the easy route in that case and for me it worked out really well. As I became a nuclear technician then lots of jobs start popping up for you so again you have to decide well do I want to have an easy life, have a normal nine to five job. Do I want to go home at the end of the night or should I try this supervisory position that you hear that they have to stay on the ship later, they have more responsibly put on them, they're blamed a lot more for things. So basically you have to make your life worse some people would say, but I think it's just more responsible. Just like with any job the more responsibility you take, the more risks you have of getting in trouble now because you're taking care of this work center your blamed for that work center if something goes wrong. However if you can do your good job and have that work center be better because of you. You tell the people what to do and they have less of incidence of failure you bring your boss down there and say well this is the way it used to be but I told this person to do X, this person to do Y and now this person is better because of that. So now that supervisor that's in front of you will give you an award for that so the only way to progress yourself, to become a chief, senior chief, master chief, is to put yourself in that role to take on those risks of failure and ultimately reap the rewards.","What kind of risks do you need to take in this field?

clintanderson_A94_2_1,"Education, Growth/learning, Advice,Navy","I went to college after I did the military. I think that's one way to do it, but you have a wide range of opportunities for college. If you ask if you should go to college before you start serving that depends on what you wanna do. If you wanna have a very good enlisted career, and you don't plan on becoming an officer then I suggest that you join the military right away. Officers need a college degree, so if you get the college degree first then you can become an officer as soon as you join the military. You can apply to become an officer and every year thereafter, however you probably wouldn't start your career four years later. So that could be a hindrance if you wanna have a full enlisted career. For people that aren't sure what the what they want to do, I still suggest that they join the military right away because you can go to school while you're in the military. I took a few classes myself. So if you decide that college isn't for you then you didn't waste those four years. Also military college can be free in many cases. It can be very very cheap, they have the tuition assistance that can reduce the price by a few thousand dollars or ultimately make it free and you can down take lots of classes during your off time. So that means you can kill two birds with one stone, you can get the work experience and you can do college at night time. For some people like me, I didn't want the military work to interfere with my school. I wanted to get As, so that's why even though I wanted to go to school the entire time that I was in the military, I waited until I got out so I could use the Montgomery GI Bill, so I could go to a very expensive university, and so that I could really focus on my school without worrying about work in the middle. So between going to school in the beginning if you want to become an officer, going to school during your career if you're thinking about making the military a career itself, or doing college at the very end, so you can enjoy the Montgomery GI Bill, the post 9-11 benefits, and all the free stuff. You have to decide where you fit in that range.","Should I go to college before or after serving?

So America spends I think six hundred billion dollars per year, which is from what I understand several times more than any other country. It's maybe the next six countries combined total, that's what the military spends. So what are we using that money for I would say that it's policing the world. We make sure that we have a huge military so that there aren't huge fights breaking out all over the world like it used to be two hundred three hundred years ago because there wasn't a main force. Then you have England attack France, Iraq attack Saudi Arabia, I'm making up countries but you understand that there wasn't a global force for good making sure that everybody isn't going crazy with all the attacking. So yes America does attack itself too and there's an ideology behind that. But ultimately as long as America can control the huge fights that break out then I'd say that people for the most part in most countries will appreciate that protection that we are providing.","How can your work change the world?

We can see that the policing that we're doing isn't fully effective in the way that we are seeing decreases in the level of violence around the world. We are seeing the same or even more than when I was in the military, so that could be something that we can look forward to in the military from now on.","What do you see as the major problems for those working in this field today?

At least in my work center of course I'm always going to be turning to the person right beside me, the senior chief or even the master chief of the command to kind of give me directions so that I can become a better chief myself. I expect them to tell me when I'm messing up. I expect them to kinda correct me in a lot of situations and to give me lots of advice. So, in my work center it's going to be the next person, next enlisted person in front of me. However, as an electrician I also have a lot of respect for the academic side of the science. So for instance when I read about things, read about nuclear technology things and the way they are improving from MIT or from Berkeley or from other places that, you know, promote nuclear technology then I'm really proud of them as well, and that's why I started becoming a university student myself because I want to follow in that direction.

I never gambled before I wanted to see if I could take one thousand dollars and make ten thousand dollars. I said you know, I'm going to into this five star hotel you know, gambling on the bottom and I said I can stop. Ten thousand dollars that's enough for a car. I will come back and I won't gamble anymore I'll go out into the world. I had this trick that I could do for roulette which is like you take one dollar and if you lose it then you bet two dollars, if you lose it then you bet four dollars, if you lose then you bet eight dollars and eventually you're gonna win you know. Even if you lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose, if you win on that tenth time as long as you keep doubling then you get all your money back and you know. So anyways I tried this trick. So we went to Australia and I was down in the bottom of the hotel and I was there for maybe seven hours six hours on my roulette wheel. So I started off with a hundred, I actually did Black Jack and I got into like two three hundred and I started roulette you know with my special trick and I got it up to two thousand dollars. So I'm like ""ah I'm on my way you know it actually does work."" So I went up to my room for that night, I was drinking champagne in the bathtub like watching TV you know and then I thought like wait a second I'm in Australia. Clint. Did you just spend your whole day in the gambling in a little you know off to the side hotel and gambling spot you know like like you can gamble in Las Vegas come on you know you should you should get out there and try to explore the country some. So the next day I go back down there and it's so funny there's this old lady who was there and she was there the night before, right. I went up to you know like take a nap and drink and I came back and she was still gambling right. So she was gambling on the hundred dollar chip tables and before I was doing like ten, ten dollar tables so I was like you know what? Here is my money let me go ahead and you know try to get this ten thousand dollars as fast as possible. So I go to right beside her, you know she is the only one at the table. Start betting hundred dollars, hundred dollars, hundred dollars. It's all gone. Whoop- bye two thousand dollars. I mean I left and I enjoyed Australia so. I like that story because it taught me to not be scared of losing money. Money didn't have that power over me that I did when I was, when I was a kid.","Tell me a funny story.

The electronics store that I went to it was, it had like ten floors and one of the floors is like Best Buy in America. Best Buy is America's most most most, it has the most electronic stuff that America can provide and it's on one big you know humongus floor but Japan has eight of those guys like if you want a camera at Best Buy well here's a stand you know you can see below there's fifty cameras, oh cool.

The first one is computer science itself, which is everything that's associated with the laptop that's in front of you. That includes the theory that's behind it, the abstractions that are associated with thinking about the way that you know, computers should work. That involves the electronics that are behind it, you open up the computer and you can see the mother board, you can see the resistors, you can see the current that's traveling through it. So that's the hardware portion, that's the thing that's on the screen that deals with web design that deals with the way that the colors look, also graphics. That's how the light comes from the computer and hits your eyes. There's the user experience part which is when you have buttons all over the screen, and maybe this button shouldn't be like here, maybe people want it bigger or smaller, maybe they want it on the other side screen. Maybe they think that it's boring, but if you change it in a certain way so that it's more fun. So that's, all of that combined is computer science. But what most people think about when they think of computer science is actually the coding part. Coding is what happens when you have your laptop open, you open up a program and you start pushing buttons on your computer screen to write lines of code so that when you compile it, you press play, it does something for you. So for instance you can make a game, you compile the game and all of a sudden you can play the game. Or you can make, you can start coding and then when you press play, you have Microsoft Word based on the code that you wrote. So that's what most people think about when they think of computer science, they think of the program that's associated with it, but computer science is a very broad range.","What do you do in computer science/programming?

My life wasn't extremely tough, it's the way that I looked at it, other people would say that I had a tough life. I mean I've seen roaches in my bathroom I've had mice crawl over my feet. I've, I've smelled gunpowder you know, from outside. I've had a pimp you know, hit his prostitute outside my door. These are things that I've experienced and I gotta say you know, as much as, as strong as I want to be for saying you know, it didn't affect me I'm strong but I think that you know, it really changed my life and I know that a lot of people, especially ones that join the military have had similar careers you know my story is not unique. So I think one of the things that has helped me in order to look at my past better is to have different experiences. Another thing that I'm proud of is the fact that my dad was in the army and I got to go to Germany. So just being in that other environment, being surrounded by German kids, needing to speak the German language, you know eating bratwurst you don't like, having that different experience allowed me to come back to Flint and say you know, this isn't life, this is one part of life, but there are people in Florida that are you know going to Disneyland, people in Germany you know doing Octoberfest, there are people in Japan you know eating Ramanan watching anime. This is just one small sliver, and if you can somehow escape from that environment, or even maybe do something within that environment to make it better you know, then you can see that you don't have to be disheartened by your, by your surroundings.

I realized that after I put in contacts and took off my glasses, and I start working out you know, I was working out, I was on the track and field club so I ran all the time and I could notice my muscles getting bigger, my chest you know I could shake them.

So if you ask a mechanic what a regulator is, it's something that regulates some kind of flow. So for instance you could have water going in this direction and then you maybe turn a switch or apply some, some setting to a control mechanism that separates it into different, different paths. So let's say need a little bit of water and you have a lot of water over here then you regulate it so that only a little bit flows out. But let's say you need lots of water here, then you regulate it so that there's lots of water that comes out. So the same thing happens with an electrician, my job. We have voltage regulators so let's say you have a pump that needs twenty volts and you have a machine that can provide all of that, you just don't wanna pump all of the current from that machine into that little, little box, right. So you have a regulator that provides the right voltage so that that voltage will just allow the correct current to go through that machine. That's a voltage regulator.","What is a regulator?

I thought we were going to be working on nuclear bombs and I think if I would have known a little bit more about it then I would've had better jump start for my career. So for instance if I knew about like, that the nuclear technology field dealt with the internals of making nuclear power with uranium, then I would study more about that, and my schooling would had a better, I would've understood my schooling a lot better. If I would have picked up a little bit of electrician knowledge beforehand, like for instance, I had no idea what the difference between voltage and current was until I was midway in my A school, my initial school learning. So it would be really nice if I would have understood some of those basic concepts before I started the school. My grades would have been higher, I would have gotten more awards, maybe I would've understood the material, the complex material that was being presented to me in a much, in a much better way if I would've had like fifty or sixty percent knowledge beforehand.

So personally my passion was music and art. I wasn't an engineer person per se, when I was a kid all the way up until a couple years after I joined the navy. That's right, I joined as an engineer and I wasn't an engineer until after I got to my first ship. I, to tell you the truth, I didn't even like it too much. I like talking languages, and you know conversing with people, and you know writing stuff, and typing on the computer. I did not want to see oil, I did not want to touch a wrench you know, that wasn't for me, but in the end, it brings me to my second point. Try to become really good at the skills that you possess. So for me, I think I'm a good electrician. I became a supervisor after some time, and it's not because I had a passion for electrician things, it's because I found that I was good at it, and that gave me motivation to learn more and more about it, and once I started doing that then it became easy for me. And after it becomes easy for you, then you can start explaining things really well, you can start reading a book and learning more about it really well, you start getting awards for it, you start you know wanting to know more about it.

So then I set shut that book and then I kind of gave up on looking at salaries for awhile. A question that I would have, a question that I wish I would asked someone, is what are the different salaries that people can make and how can I become more involved in getting those high paying, those high paying jobs.

However, some of the classes that you learn with electrical engineering are computer science, and I went to a research internship. It wasn't an internship it was just research for UC Berkeley, and I thought I was going to do electrical engineering, but they had so many cool computer science topics and professors and little things around campus that really empowered me to kind of consider computer science as a career. So when I went back home, when I was done with the research and I went back home, I really focused on my computer science classes and I just realized, hey you know out of all the classes that I am learning, math, science, english, the computer science classes were some of the most fun, and I just thought you know, if I want to make my own business, if I was doing electrical engineering I'd have to go to radio shack, I'd have to buy resistors, I'd have to spend lots of money, I'd have to like spend lots of time.

And I kept coming back to the thinking you know what, the military is a good way to start. I knew about their money for education, I knew about, after you do your tour you could have a really good professional career outside of the military you know. So these things were in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, I tried to join in high school and my eyesight is really bad, so they had disqualified me from joining. So I spent two years outside of high school trying to you know make my way through community college, make my way through various odd jobs, and it just wasn't for me.

I know about lots of things that I had never even considered myself interested in before. So does that help me, in a sense, I think it does. It gives me a better perspective. Would I do it over again? So the thing that I'm lacking from doing my nuclear technology path, is I don't have a long history with computer science. So I think if I would have joined like for instance the IT field, the information technology field, then after eight years I'd be really really bright about computer science and networks and what's going on in the, on the interior of a computer. However, the problem would be that I wouldn't know the electrical portion of it.

But that's kinda like free time you know, so you can't like read comic books, you can't watch a movie there, so with that spare time they actually tell you, open up the books you know. Open up and keep your training going yourself. So that's what I used to do, that's what I did, and it's, I found out that month after month you know, year after year, my knowledge was steadily improving, and I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I was reading a lot during my watches.","How can I work smarter?

If you're an introvert, it would be good for your career if you can kinda like express yourself a little bit you know, kind of be friends with the person that's working beside you. You know you might watch a lot of military movies and see guns, see people fighting and shooting, and you know like eventually you can see that they become a band of brothers you know even if they're girls but band of brothers right, that's the saying. And if you can try to you know live up to that movie stereotype, then that would work very well with your superiors because the key word, the only word that really matters for the military is teamwork, and the more that you can show that you're a team, the more that you can like relate to your peers, then that would look really good with your superiors.","What would you advice a person in this field to do in order to create good relationships with bosses?

They provide your housing in a different type of way, they provide your food in a different type of way. So this is what I mean. When you just join the military, they know you don't make that much cash, so what they do is, they, some people they have to make them stay on the ship, you know, to sleep. After you make it to around, like, E5, the second class petty officer level, then they start giving you this thing called B.A.H. It's basic allowance for housing. They say, ""If you choose to, you're allowed to find an apartment out in the world and we'll give you money for it."" In other locations if you're second class petty officer, then they might allow you to stay in the houses on base. Especially if you are in a foreign country, then, you know, you'll probably be staying on base. As you get a lot higher in rank, like, for instance if you're a chief or a senior chief, master chief or if you're an officer, then they probably give you lots of cash and they allow you to, like, find a much bigger house. Because chances are, those people probably have bigger families.","Does the Navy give you housing?

One was Charleston, South Carolina, then I moved up to Albany, New York, then I moved down across the country to San Diego. Then I moved up from there to Birmington, Washington. Now they all had a different flavor. One was a really good climate with lots of people, that's San Diego. Birmington was kind of more to the countryside, but you can have bigger houses and you can do hiking and skiing you know  but it got pretty cold and rainy. New York was close to New York City, but Albany is lots of green trees everywhere you know. The houses are really big, but nothing was around that area. There was no building more than like five stories high you know, that's Albany for you so it's a very quiet town. And in Charleston, South Carolina I guess it's kind of like old style, and more south. So out of all those places that I've been since I've been in the military, I'm a California person, so I gotta do the San Diego thing.","What has been your favorite place to live?

So my job is a nuclear technician, and unfortunately we're only allowed to stay domestic. However they do give you opportunities to change your roles. Not your job, I'll always be an Electrician's Mate, but your roles throughout your career, they understand that they can't just put somebody on a boat you know for twenty years and think that he'll retire. He'll go crazy, right? So after your tour of maybe four years, then they provide you some opportunities to do different type of work. So they can send you to a shore command, let's say in San Diego where you can kinda like just chill at one of the facilities there, no boats, just a nine to five job. They also, they offered me to go to Italy to work on a sub tender, which is kinda like being on a little boat, you get lots of port calls and stuff so that's one opportunity to go overseas, but if you do like four years on an aircraft carrier, then a couple more years on another boat, that's a lot of sea time. So that was one opportunity for me. They also had another aircraft carrier that was stationed in Japan, it was called the USS Kitty Hawk. However it like, that's where I was going to go, I was in camp like let you know four places in America or send me to Japan? I'm going to Japan, that's where I'm going to go you know, but nah unfortunately we weren't able to go on that. No nukes go on the Kitty Hawk anymore, so we were just on domestic soil for that whole time, dangit.","Did the Navy give you a chance to live overseas?

clintanderson_A156_3_1,"Military, Growth/learning, Recognition,Navy","So everybody joins the military as an E1 in boot camp, regardless of your rate. So once you join the military you get some kinds of incentives to join, so being a nuclear technician we're allowed to become E3s immediately. But in boot camp everyone's E1. So as soon as boot camp ended, then I was promoted to a fireman, which is the the engineering side of E3 right, and I did that for school, I was in school for six months, and by the time I graduated that school after six months, I was promoted to a first class petty officer, which is E4. Then I was, I went to nuclear power school, and then prototype training. They're both six months and six months, then I went to my first ship. Now when I finally got to my first ship, that's when I had been in for two years and also because of my rate, nuclear technician, they offered us to automatically be promoted to second class petty officer, that's E5. And that's what I did, they offered us some cash, I got forty thousand dollars in cash, and it was tax free because we were fighting the war and I got automatically promoted to E5. So up until that time that for the first two years I'd always been automatically promoted either by school or just by joining, or just by signing a contract for an additional two years. That automatic promotion to E5 was because I extended my contract from six years to eight years. After that time, after that two years, then I was, I got promoted four years later to E6. So I was promoted E5 in 2002 promoted E6 in 2006, and then I guess I spent two more years in the military, and then I got out after eight years as an E6, which is first class petty officer. Then I made chief, which is what I am now, E7 in 2010, so that's four more years after. So again the time line is I joined boot camp, that's E1, after boot camp, which is about three months, then I was E3, a year and a half later I was, I'm sorry six months later I was E4, at my two year point I was an E5, and then four years later I was an E6, and four more years after that I was E7, chief.","What was your promotion track throughout your Navy service?

clintanderson_A157_3_1,"Military, Money,Navy","So my salary obviously it changes every time I get promoted. It also changes every two years, so the longer that you're in the military you get a little bit more money. So right now I'm a chief and it depends on which, which city you live in, which is gonna dictate your BAH your basic allowance for housing, but everybody makes the same basic pay. So my basic pay right now is $4,500 per month, if I were to be active active duty service, and I also get another couple thousand dollars are for my BAH which is the money that they give you for housing. So all in all it's about $75,000 per year with 16 years in. A person who just barely comes in, he's not going to get, he or she is not going to get that BAH. They will probably just be living on a ship or something like that, and as far as the basic pay, it's probably just a couple thousand dollars maybe $3,000 when you talk about outside of boot camp. So it's about $35,000 to start. So one year in the military you're at $35,000, 16 years you're at $75,000, and that's from an E1 to a chief, it ramps accordingly.","What was your salary throughout your Navy service?

clintanderson_A158_3_1,"Military, Jargon,Navy","The military is divided up into two parts. You have the enlisted and you also have the officers. Officers are people who have been to college, who have a degree, and who have been awarded a commission, which means their job is to take care of people, their job is to have a command underneath them. So the people that they hire are called the enlisted people. Enlisted people just have to have a college degree or, sorry not college degree, a high school degree or a GED, and then you're able to join the military. You're sent to a vocational school, it's called A school, and from that time then you are actually like the performer, the technical person, the person who drives the ship, or the person who makes the pump, or the person who checks the voltage. So the officers are the people in charge, the enlisted people are the ones who do it. So the enlisted people have a ranking from E1 to E9. An E1 is, it could be, well there are three types. There are the people that deal with aircraft things, people who deal with ship type things, and then people who are engineers. So the engineers are called firemen, the ship type people are called seamen, and the airforce jet type people are called airmen. So there's airmen recruit, then you go airman apprentice, and then you have just a regular airman for E3. That's E1, E2, and E3. After that, E4, E5, and E6, those are called petty officers, so E4 is called third class petty officer, E5 is second class petty officer, and E6 is first class petty officer. And then you have three more which is are chiefs. So I'm an E7 which is a chief and they have a slightly different emblem for their uniform. They're all gold and you can see that this is an anchor. So if you just have this, that's a chief, if you have a star right here that's a E8, that's a senior chief. If you have two stars right here, that's a master chief. So again, E1, E2, E3, petty officer, third class, second class, and first class, and then chiefs: chief, senior chief, master chief. Officers they're their own beasts.","Can you explain the ranking system E and numbers?

O4 is Lieutenant Commander. O5 is Commander. O6 is a Captain and Captains are the ones, they're basically really really high in their officer community. They're the people that command the ship, command the aircraft carrier, those are Captains. After that, then you have people who have been Captains for a long time and they're super senior people that you see on TV, those are the Admirals. So you have Rear Admiral Lower Half, Upper Half, Vice Admiral and Admiral. That's O7, O8, O9, and O10.","Can you explain the ranking system O and numbers?

A lot of people that join they think well it is my first place that I've been staying you know. So like no matter what it is, they'll have a lot of complaints but I realize, I grew up in Flint, Michigan you know, so the fact that they gave me a nice clean bed with clean furniture and a desk right there you know, and that's all they give, and a closet you know. It looks like a tiny little hotel you know, like kind of a cheap hotel, but for me that's you know and the fact that it's free like really blew my mind away. So the other place that you can stay at, for instance the Navy Gateway Inn, or the Navy lodge, they're some of the highest quality hotels that you can find. For instance I was in Hawaii a couple of years ago and I stayed at like this expensive like $300 hotel, and it was nice you know there's a bed, king size bed and you know. But then you stay at the Navy lodge down the street and it's like a huge room with nice fans and there's like, the bedroom has its own door. The bathroom is like you can swim in it, you know you go outside and there's like three couches and there's like TVs for every room, it's crazy. It has its own separate kitchen so like they realize that you know the military people that are traveling across the country, they need a nice place to stay. So it's some of the best places that I've stayed at. Now the place that the military provides for the sailors, it's very quaint. But those places that you go on for vacation, or the places that the Admirals stay at, or the places that you have to pay for that's not, that isn't for official work, they're some of the nicest in America.","What were your living quarters like in the Navy?

So for instance, let's say there's a robbery, chances are there's alcohol involved. If there's a crash, there's probably alcohol involved. If there is a fight, chances are there is alcohol involved. So I say that the common crime is drinking alcohol, but that's not a crime in itself. The other things are kind of collateral damage, so yeah if you're on a ship for a year, then you will see that somebody has robbed, one person on the ship has robbed somebody out there in the world, you will hear about four fights, five fights that got people demoted, and you will hear about three drunk driving's. Maybe there was no crash but they just got caught for it. So those are the common crimes that I see committed.","What are common crimes that military people commit?

So if we're about to fight a war, or if we're in the middle of a war, then you can expect that they're trying to increase the size of the military, and for that then they provide a bonus. If there, if it's kinda peacetime or if they're downsizing the Navy, then obviously they offer less. So it's a size shaping tool that the Navy has to get people to come in and leave. With that said, in most cases for their advanced jobs, they almost always have some kind of incentive. It ranges in the amount, but it's there nonetheless. So the amount that I received, they gave me the choice, they said I could have $12,000 in cash, you know minus taxes, or you could have a really big educational bonus. It was $50,000. So I knew I was going to go to college and I wanted to make sure that I didn't you know like spend the money early so I said give me the educational bonus at the end. A lot of people that I knew like I guess the first year I was in you know, people had new cars they put down payments on like nice musical equipment and stuff like that. So some other jobs that you could have that provide bonuses, are obviously a lot of the STEM jobs. So there's Electrician's Mate, that's not inside the nuclear field but just regular electricians. There's Fire Controlmen FC's. So those are the ones who fix like all of the, from the engineering plants up. That mean's like the top part of the ship, not dealing with the nuclear side, just from engineering and up you know. They have to be pretty bright too, so they get bonuses. And Cryptological Technicians that learn languages, they're the spies, the ones who like listen, try to find out what foreign people are are up to, they get cash bonuses.

After you've been in for twenty years, then you're allowed to have retirement. At the end of your twenty years, you can either on say I would like to retire, or you can stay in up to thirty years. So every year that you're in you get to have two and a half percent longer than twenty years. At twenty years you get half of your basic pay, so this is what I mean. The Navy gives you lots of money while you're in based on certain things. Sixty percent of what you make is your basic pay, then you get a little more for sustenance, which is just the basic things that you need for your home. You also get a little bit more for if you're on a submarine or not. Also you get some more basic allowance for housing for your housing costs. But sixty percent of that is your basic pay. So the navy gives you half that at a twenty year point. I'm a chief, I make $4,500 per month so they give me half of that at twenty years. If I chose to stay in longer then the add on another two and a half percent, two and a half percent, two and a half percent. Depending on what I retire as, it can be up to thirty years, so at thirty years that'll be seventy five percent of your basic pay.

I actually tried to join the airforce at first, but I ended up in the Navy. There's gonna be somebody behind a desk that's going to you know say can you please have a seat, so why do you want to join? What kinds of things interest you? They'll ask lots of questions about like how did in high school, what your interests are, and see if you're a good fit. They're also trying to see if you have a kind of criminal background and if you seem maybe uncommitted, they'll probably push you to the side. But they want to give everybody a chance so after you have your initial conversation with him, he'll ask you to take a practice test. It could be right there at that same time. So the recruiter will guide you to another room and the test is kind of like a little mini scholostic achievement test, a mini SAT. It has a little bit of physics there, math there, a little bit of english there, just general things. So you don't have to be scared of the test, it's not a pass or fail. It's more like what types of jobs you can have. So you take the test and where you score he'll say he has a list of maybe sixty, seventy jobs these are the ones that you qualify for. If you don't qualify for the job you want, then you're allowed to practice a little bit more. He'll give you some resources that you can use to study. But by that time if you are decided on the type of job that you want, that you're willing to do, then he will take you to, he or she will take you to this thing called MEPS, it's military entrance processing place that you can go to with lots of other people who are interested in joining the military to take the real test. The real test is nice and quiet, it's a lot longer, it's very comprehensive, and that's when they can offer you the real job. They'll probably serve you some breakfast in the morning it's an all day thing, and assuming that you pass the test on that same day, they can also have, get you through medical at that time which means that they'll check your eyes, check your dental, make sure that you're physically fit to go through it, and maybe the entire recruiting process could take maybe a week, maybe even a couple of days I have heard. But for me it took several months. They have you in this thing called delayed entrance processing where you do your test, you figure out the job that you want and maybe you don't have to join the service until a good time for them, which could be like a year later or maybe after your high school, after you graduate high school or after you finish your job or something like that.","Describe the hiring process.

After that time, then you're supposed to go off to your ship unless your in an advanced program like I was, in which case you'll go on to another school. My next school was a nuclear power school for another six months, and then after that I had prototype training, which means that they sent me to a real prototype to train on the real thing with people watching me, of course and that was six months.

So you go to this place near the Chicago area and they put you in a division, it's about maybe thirty people or so. It's very very strict there. Everybody's in bunk beds and be teach you how to make your bed, but it's in a very special way. All the creases have to be aligned perfectly, all of the sheets have to be super clean and facing the same way. So it's not, when they teach you to make this bed, it's not the fact that they want you to make a bed this way, it's the fact that they're looking to make sure that you can follow directions. They give you a list of steps and they make sure that number one you don't talk back to them, number two that you do it at the time that it is supposed to be done, at six o'clock or at five o'clock in the morning, with you standing outside of your bed with it already been made. They make sure that there's nothing on the bed or inside the bed, or that it's all made the same way. So there's a lot that goes into making this bed. So I'm mentioning this bed part because everything about boot camp is the exact same way, from the books that you train on, to the knots that you're making, to the way that you do your drills. It's not that they're trying to teach you these things, they are but they're actually filtering out who has no problem with following directions and who needs a little bit more time to train in these things, and for some reason like let's say you come from a bad neighborhood, you don't like being talked to and yelled at, those are people that would have problems if they go out into the real service. So they take those people to the side, maybe they're in boot camp for a little bit longer or maybe they actually get kicked out of boot camp. But by the time you get done with your three months or four months of boot camp, you should have a good idea of what discipline is like, and how to follow directions from the simplest of tasks to the more complex tasks.","What is boot camp like?

clintanderson_A170_3_2,"Opportunities, Fit, Military,Navy","The field that you want to work in is specifically guided by how well you did on the test. So basically you rate. So it's very important to kind of, if you do want to work in a demanding field, to try to score as high as you can. If you don't get the job you want when you tried first tried, then before you join try to you know bump it up a little bit you know, to try to get that job. So once you're in the military, then there's gonna be a big range of jobs that you can do. You can work in the library, you can work you know with electrical components, at least for me as an Electrician's Mate I had a wide range of things that I could do. So if you're trying to ask which job I can do, which job can I apply for, a lot of it's kind of political. A lot of it's well you know like we've known him for a while, he's been on the ship for a long time so like he has a choice. Since you just come to the ship then like this is the only job that we have for you you know. You could be painting this deck or scrubbing this floor, right that's the job that we have for you. But if you've been in for a lot longer then you have a little bit of leeway in asking for jobs, and again you know within your rate, it depends on how high you score. So for instance there's going to be people who will be providing work to other people who are going to be writing it down, writing their job descriptions down and providing it. We need those people to be some of the brightest so if you don't have a good work history, then you might not be able to apply for for that job. So number one try to score as high as possible, and number two try to learn on the job as much as possible, and that's how you can get the best job that you want.","How can I request to work in a certain area or field?

I wasn't a very good student. I got good grades but it was really difficult for me to learn the material myself. Like for instance one of the things that we learned is what grounds are you know, and it took me so long to figure out what a ground is, like ground they say it's the earth you know. Like what do you mean by that? Eventually you find out that ground means that that's a plane of neutral electricity so that you can have high voltage and low voltage and ground means, and there is a way to learn it but it just took me a really long time to learn it because I wasn't really technical. So that's a really simple thing I learned that you know like I had to catch up on, but they're a lot more complex things you know, like when you learned about multiplexes, you're learning about the way that the voltage regulator really works on the inside you know. Those can be really difficult so it's a wrap your head around, but eventually with enough opening the pages and putting your eyes on it over and over and over, it become simple. Everything becomes simple with lots of practice.","What was the most difficult part of your training?

It's not you know, you have a wide range just like any other job out there, so once you get past that then you have to realize the book that you're reading maybe is written by computer scientists themselves you know. So there could be a time when you have to close the book and go you know prep yourself a little bit more you know, find some material online, find some easy to understand topics that can kind of prep you to go back to the more difficult book that you're reading in your hands. So yeah the material can be hard sometimes, the projects that we have can be you know really demanding, but with enough time you know, they say seven years you become an expert.

clintanderson_A174_3_2,"Money, Military","The salaries that the military people make, they kind of range in how they compare to what civilians make. So officers kind of make slightly less than their civilian counterparts. That is, an officer you can take any officer and put them in a civilian job and they'd probably be making about ten to twenty thousand dollars more in the civilian sector. However, there's a lot of job security that comes with being in the military. You're not going to get fired unless you like really messed up. Now that you're protecting our country and you're doing it in an efficient manner you know, you're doing it effectively. So there's a cost with that and the cost is our salary, so there is a saying that the military don't make that much, and it can be true in some cases. However if you do it with pride and you enjoy you work and you think about the excellent retirement benefits that they give you, you'll see that maybe by the end of your twenty years you know, you didn't make that much less, however you have a much more fulfilling career. For enlisted people, it could very very similar or even better than your civic counterparts, at least for nuclear technicians we made a lot less than our civilian counterparts.  In fact many people get out after six or eight years and then they start working and they could easily make double what they're making. That is they leave as a first class petty officer making about sixty five or seventy thousand dollars a year and then they can make double that working as Homer Simpson you know down at the nuclear power plant. Other things like maybe a cook or Boatsmen's Mate or let's say a weapons handler, they can find very very similar jobs out there so then they have the choice. Do I stay in the military that I've already put in like maybe six or seven years, or I do I become a civilian, maybe have to start all over, but start at a higher rate and higher job position than I would have if I would just join from high school. So many people in that position they probably stay in military because the retirements, and the amount of time they put in as far as their pride you know. All of that makes them stay in so.","How does an officer's/non-officer's salary compare to civilian salaries?

So our schedule is we do one and a half years on the shore, and then we do six months at sea. We do that twice and after that time, after that four year period, then you're scheduled to go work on a short command, and that should be anywhere from two to three years. So it depends on whether we're at war or not, whether the up tempo is really high or not, whether the ship that you're on has been out to sea a lot, but that's generally, the two year, the two year ship shore schedule is generally what it is.","How significant is there a chance of being deployed?

Now I won't lie, the bigger the ship you're on the more opportunities that are available. So you have a really small ship let's say a destroyer, that's not small but like the destroyer is I guess a ship that has maybe a couple thousand people on it. It's kind of like a high school you could say, the size of a high school. And there aren't that many things to do. I've never been on a destroyer but I just know from my experience with the aircraft carrier. It has to have less than what I had and at least for an aircraft carrier which has five thousand people usually. When we're on deployment we have, it goes up to eight thousand people when you add all the people that come in with airplanes, and the people that take care of the airplanes, and the extra officers and enlisted people. Eight thousand people is the size of a small city. So on an aircraft carrier we have our own post office, we have our own little recreation center. We have a couple of places for fitness, but in general it is a war craft vessel. Therefore there aren't that many, there are limited places that you can do, that you can have on the ship that cater to entertainment. So people find their own entertainment. So for me, my entertainment on the ship was I'd watch movies all the time. So everybody has their own little laptop or their DVD player, you can rent movies from the little recreation center that's there. They had bands in little hidden spots of the ship. So there would be drums and guitars and you know like even keyboards all hidden, but that did they make space and you know they play as loud as they want. Obviously the fitness centers are there, and you can see card playing all over the place. Whenever there is a rack, a living quarter, then there's this little table outside you know like three or four of them. With couches to watch TV to watch movies and to play cards right there, so that's how we spent our deployments.","What things are there for me to do on a ship?

Now I know that sounds cliche, but that's the way that I feel. I came from a really military family. My uncle was in the military, my dad was in the military, my brother was in the military, and me too, and although yes I could of just been a civilian, like I was on that path. It felt like, at least for me in particular, it felt like something would've been missing from my life, something I can't be on my death bed and say that I never protected my country the way that I saw my family protect it. So it was a calling for me. Why would other people join the military especially if you don't have military people in your family, you have to think. Well first you have to trust your politicians. You'd have to think that they're going to war and they're defending America for good reason. So the wars that we fight we hope will bring stability to the world. You might see on TV that you know children are bloodied and people are you know like running for their lives, running from terrorism, running from lots of different things, you know you've seen the news. So if you wanna be a part of bringing that to an end, then military is one way that you can at least try. Also defending the nation, now we've been safe for a long time. Yes we had 9-11 and yes there are domestic terrorists but compared to other countries in the world, you might realize that America is a pretty safe place to live. When you're considering foreign powers trying to come in and influence us. So we have that strong military to thank for that.

That's fine for a lot of people, but for me I chose to try something different than the military job that I was doing because I wanted my job to be persistent. So this is what I mean. Right now I'm with the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technology making this video. This video could be seen by thousands, hundreds of thousands, hopefully millions of other Navy people. I could affect those lives. These are things that are going to be happening you know five years from now, ten years from now. So I can actually affect my world. Many engineering communities are like that. If you're making a robot right, if you make that robot on January 1st, hopefully December 31st you're shipping that robot, and that robot will go to Afghanistan and find a bomb you know. If you're an electrical technician, maybe you're making some kind of new component for a car and later on that car is gonna be faster because of the component you made. So for a lot of engineering jobs you work and then you create a component, you create a product, and then you can see that product in action, and that's one of the biggest benefits of being in a STEM field.","What are the long-term impacts of entering computer science or STEM fields?

So the Navy's pretty good about that, the Air Force is the best I think, they're you know getting close to like sixty forty percent maybe even higher, male to female ratio. I think the Navy is a little bit lower it's from what I understand, maybe my aircraft carrier was one quarter female, at least that's kind of what I saw, and that's about what it was. But it could be lower, maybe twenty percent is probably what I'm guessing. The engineering field of the Navy is, on submarines depends you know which ones you're going on. If it's a fast attack submarine I think they just barely started just a couple years ago started allowing females on, and if you're on a ballistic submarine, which means they shoot nukes off, nuclear weapons off, then they don't have females on there at all.","What is the gender mix of your workplace?

The military can be very dangerous, especially like for the people that send the planes off. If you do that you know every single year, month after month, day after day, then that could affect your hearing. You can be in many dangerous situations and some people just don't want to do that type of job anymore, that can be risky. Another reason that people leave the military is because they want to see their family grow. When you're on deployment that's a good six months that you don't see your daughter grow. You don't see your son grow, you're not with your wife, you're not with your husband. So after a few of those deployments, you kinda start to miss that, you actually want to see when your spouse has their kid you know. If your wife is pregnant you want to actually see it be born.

So if you're in a job that has only a few spots available, like let's say it's a very specific job for a specific ship, or a job that's really really nice, really comfortable and no one wants to leave, then that means that those higher positions are staying there, they don't retire after eight years or ten years, they stay until twenty.

clintanderson_A190_3_2,"Military, Benefits,Navy","I'm in the military reserves, and it is exactly what the name says. It's a reserve, so we don't actively fight the wars. What we do is we, number one make sure that we are prepared to fight, and number two we train a lot to make sure that our mind is ready to fight. For me I was in the military for eight years, and then I got out joined the reserves. What that means is that the reserves call me at any time and they'll have somebody with eight years of active duty experience being able to fight. That means I know what a ship is, I know how to read the label plates to find out what I'm looking for, I know how to fix these pumps, and I know how to drive the ship, I know the valves to close when you're trying to shut off steam. So these are things that they don't have to teach me, as opposed to a civilian who has no experience, no training, and maybe that doesn't have the discipline to come and fight the war right away. So if we're going to fight a war, first people that go over are the active duty people. If you need more people then they call on me, the reservist people, a reserve person who stops his normal civilian job and becomes an active duty member for the amount of time that the Navy tells me to be. It could be anywhere from a few months to several years. After that time, then I'm supposed to come back to my civilian job, hopefully the civilian job is still there for me when I get back. If there's a huge war, then that's when we start calling the real civilians.","What do Navy reservists do and what benefits do they get?

Number two you need to be able to present a good managerial style, people need to think that you can lead. Just because you have a degree doesn't mean that you have the authority or, doesn't mean that you have the presence of command to get people to follow you.

If you're in a position where like you supervisor doesn't give you the the feedback that you need, he doesn't show you the right way to do things. What the Navy is really good for is having multiple resources to go to. So of course if you have one chief above you and you're an enlisted person and he's not listening to you, then what they say is that you can go above him. It's not generally expected that you do that, but it is possible you know. Everybody from the captain of the ship all the way down for the most part has an open door policy, which means that if something is on your mind you can come talk to them. Generally they like you to follow the hierarchy. So the first question that they are going to ask is ""did you ask the person underneath me?"" so beside you, if you have a problem with someone above you, you talk to the people to your left or right. Then you talk to the people, let's say it's a chief that you're complaining about, then you talk to another chief. And then, if neither of those listen, then maybe the senior chief or maybe the officer of the unit and onwards up. So if you have a problem your feedback, then there are lots of resources that you can go to.","How do you get good feedback?

clintanderson_A193_3_2,"Decisions, Military,Navy","Some of the most important decisions that I've faced have to do with morality I would say. So here's what I mean. The most important thing that you can do in the military is follow directions, but not everybody does that, unfortunately, and your tasks as a supervisor is to confront these things and take care of them appropriately. So this is what I mean. Let's say that there is somebody on the ship, coming onto the ship any he's drunk and he's not supposed to be drunk. What do you do? So you could either grab him by the collar and take him to the local Master at Arms this person in trouble right, and that's the right thing to do. Another right thing to do would be to chastise him, to handle it in house to make sure that he doesn't do it again to kind of supervise and mentor him, if you think that he's that type of person so you don't have to necessarily ruin his career. So basically it's a morality question, the type of personality that you have and how willing to stick to the books you are to make sure that you do the right thing. When it comes to things that are going on in the plants, things that are going on in the engineering field there's no morality involved. If that thing is leaking you don't think hey you know like should I fix it or not, it's not that big. No if it's leaking, if X then Y. But when you're dealing with people, people with personalities, people with emotions, people with families, you have to really take all of that into consideration and to determine the wise thing to do, not necessarily the thing that's written in the book.","What are the most important decisions that you faced as a leader in your organization?

Well I wanna be this. What do you want to be? For instance he actually taught me a lot about mortgages and stuff. I read this book that he presented its called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, and after reading that book then I kinda got ideas like okay rather than the cubicle thing I probably want to make my own business or something. I'd rather you know like have some kind of other income rather than a nine to five job. Or rather we would talk about his prior relationship and the fact that like his wife maybe didn't want to work so much. And we thought about like the income and outcome of his of a one working party system. You know like if one person doesn't work and the other person just takes care of the kids, then I guess you can't be as rich as you normally would be. So that had an effect on me, the person that I wanna meet in the future. Do I want like a housewife, which is fine you know. She could have a decent life making kids and you know making dinner and you know folding clothes. Or do I want a someone who's working, in which case like my clothes would suffer, my kids who suffer, my household chores would suffer you know.

The fact that you're supposed to push these buttons and turn these knobs and, you know, you have to do maintenance on it, so you have to open it up and clean it or something that. That could happen. Additionally, when we do General Quarters, that's when, like the whole entire ship pretends that they're at war and, you know, they have to, like, do certain things to make sure that order is kept, that fires are put out, that, you know, like, if there's a hole in the wall that's patched up if it's flooding and you have to take it out. So, all of these things, they need some kind of understanding about the technology that's behind it. So, for instance, you have a fire fighting bottle and this is any job in the military, it could be a Boatswain's Mate, it could be a Quarter Master, it could be an Electrician's Mate, we all have to understand that this bottle has to put out this fire. The fire, you have to understand, is it class Charlie fire, class Alpha fire? You have to understand that the bottle is metal and it has to be on the ground and when you blow it, when you squeeze the trigger, that it has to be on the ground so you don't get shocked because of the speed at which the coolant leaves the nozzle.

If you don't know an engineer, then even a mathematician. I don't know there's that many mathematicians I know either. So, anybody that can think logically about something, then they're probably a good person to go to and by that I mean, so if you're looking around a normal city, then anybody that is in the STEM field could probably give you some kind of idea about what they do and I don't think computer science would be that far behind. So, for instance, if you're a car mechanic. You can ask a car mechanic, ""Why do you like what you do?"". They're going to say, ""Well, I like cars. I have a few cars myself. And because I liked it so much, I wanted to know what was inside of the car. So, I remember the first time I pulled open the hood and then I was looking around on the inside and I was asking questions about all those things and at first it was very very daunting but after I learned what the, that thing there did and that engine part there did and that alternator does. Once I started learning about those, you know, then the pieces start to fit and eventually, I knew, you know, half the engine, 75% and then all of the engine and then it's really interesting at that point.""

Well, this is the resistor and this is the motherboard and, you know, this goes over here to that part and here's the blueprint for it and so, I would say the same thing that the car mechanic would say about that circuit breaker.

clintanderson_A211_4_1,"Opportunities, Benefits, Culture","The difference between working in the public and private sector, I would say would probably be, number one, the job security. If you're a public servant, it's very hard to get fired. That's a pretty common meme that we always say. You'd have to do something really terrible to be fired. You can not be promoted as much or you can get like pretty bad jobs but once you're in the system then you don't really get kicked out because of all the fairness laws in place. If you're in the private sector, then you have to realize that their main goal is to make money. That's the point of a business, to make money. So, number one, if you're not producing, if you're in the public sector, you just get kind of shifted around and if you're in the private sector, you get fired. So, you have to have a better work ethic, I think. So, for instance, in the public sector, there could be many days that you kind of just sit around, kind of with your hands in your pocket, especially if there's not that much work. You have high work and low work and during low work, then you're just not expected to do that much whereas in the private sector, they will find something for you to do because they're paying you. Otherwise, they'll just lay you off or something. So, it's two different reasons that you exist. For the public, your main goal is to serve the people and they want you to keep your job. They want to have the same workforce in play most of the time, so it doesn't really matter how the, what the job outlook is like. You're probably keep your job if they like your work experience and you're just kind of, sit there whereas the private sector, if they're doing bad, then you're doing bad and, you know, you have to maintain a good reputation, you have to, kind of, be smart and if you want to be promoted, then you have to, like, really show your worth more in the private sector. However, at least in the private sector, you get to make a lot more money. You're not on the federal pension system, you're not on the federal salary system. So, depending on what type of job you want to do in the private sector, you can make lots of money. I know some people who, like, can buy a house with the bonus that they just got, so, there's some value in that.","What is the difference between working in the public vs private sectors?

It doesn't matter which one it is. They're all the same"", which is, you know, it's true in a sense. So, C# for me, has been the easiest language to learn. Yes, all computer science languages are very very similar but some are easier to learn than others and it's because I like that for purpose. I think everything, from cars to airplanes, everything that's been created has a curve where it should be easier, the later it is in its cycle. So, when computers first came around, everybody was working with vacuum tubes, you know, physical things. Then, it became assembly language, then it became machine language, then it became A, then B, then C, then C#, then Python and Java. So, the later languages I think are based on the ones before and they said, ""Hey, how can we make this easier?"" and it just got better and better and better. So, for me, C#, it sounds like someone's talking, it sounds like, by sound I mean, you look at the code and it says ""If Bob is"". Anyways, it's really easy to read once you're reading the code and earlier versions I think are not as user-friendly. So, C# is the language for me.","What is your favorite coding language and why?

When you're on deployment, then your free time goes from maybe eight hours later in the day down to maybe two or three. You don't have that much free time. During those times, you really suck them, you really suck the juice out of them, so you're watching DVDs or you're drumming down in, like, the basement or you're just sitting back, relaxing, watching some TV or reading a comic or something like that and the two or three hours, you really make the most use of it.

But even for me, when I was taking easier classes, then I try to find part-time work, to add on the extra twenty or thirty hours to it.

For example, when I was at Berkeley, I was taking my artificial intelligence class and there are about four hundred people. There there was one other African American female, she always sat in the front and there was me. Besides that, it was basically whites and Asians. For the military, I'm an Electrician's Mate on the nuclear side and that's not very ethnically diverse either. That's because nuclear technology and basically engineering, is kind of a higher level field and unfortunately, blacks and Hispanics don't really shine in those areas as much as whites and Asians do. So, the military is very diverse but blacks and Hispanics are usually in the fields that don't require as much technical thinking but at least on the civilian side, at least in school, Berkeley had lots of different cultures but they're mainly in the humanities section not so much the engineering section. That's something that I'm trying to change myself. That's the reason that I'm in computer science at the first place because I want to do education so I can help people like me, you know, who were young and wanted to have some kind of inspiration to do technically oriented jobs but I didn't really know where to start, so. It has a long way to go. In fact, even at USC, out of the whole entire games department, I'm the only black person that's there.

So, I've lived in a white household, not the entire time, but for some portion of my life and I kind of saw the way that education was being presented to me and to the students that I saw around us. Education is number one, you're supposed to be doing your homework when you come home. You know, there's probably an hour, two hours that you have to, you know, focus on your education and then you can go play, things like that. Whereas in the black households that I lived in, it really wasn't an issue. For instance, my mother, she didn't even graduate high school. My father did, but he wasn't really interested in my education. So, there were things that I did when I was a kid. They give you five dollars if you, you know, like, do all your homework for that week or they look at your report card and, you know, ""As and Bs, okay, well, you know, you don't get in trouble"" or things like that. But it wasn't really, college wasn't really pushed. For instance, I never heard the name of any college from any of my family, my mom's side or my dad's side, because they were divorced right. So, that's opposed to the white households that I lived in and, you know, then you're always hearing about University of Michigan and, you know, we're going to go to a college game this weekend or this person is coming from University of Nebraska and you know, here is what he's doing. So, it's, those things are pushed on you, you know, every week, every other day, you know, it's part of the culture. You're expected to graduate from high school and then go on to college and that's very obvious whereas in the, I even lived in a Mexican household and it just wasn't there. The parents usually didn't go to college themselves and it's more like you have a range of different possibilities. You can go to college, if you're smart or you can work down the street, that's where your father worked. Or, you can just live your own life and make your own choices. Those are the options that are available and that are persistent in minority cultures. So, I think, we, if you want to send more kids to college, it should be an expectation that you're go to college from the family, rather than just be a choice and do whatever you want to do.","Why are there fewer minorities in STEM?

I was just talking to my friend the other day and we were just saying, ""At least when I was in school, girls actually did better than guys in math and science. I mean, they're the ones who are always submitting their homework, you know, always got the best grades, maybe guys, kind of, just, like, sit back and don't really, like, pay much attention. So, you think that girls would be in abundance in STEM but it turns out to be the opposite. After you get into college, it switches. Girls are mostly humanities and guys are mostly, you know, technically oriented and I think it has to do with just the mindset of girls, I guess. Maybe because so many guys are in the technical roles, then maybe girls get to college and think, ""Well, you know, those technical jobs are for guys. So, let me go ahead and, you know, do something humanities oriented, because it's like that already."" So, I think if we just, like, reset, if we, like, kick everyone out of college and then all of a sudden, you know, we have a fresh batch of people in and, you know, we don't tell people who's running NASA, who's running Microsoft, you know, it's all a secret. Then, I think maybe it would be about half-half, you know, there'd be half as many girls at MIT as guys but because, you know, maybe they step foot on MIT and say, ""Okay, well, you know, like what jobs do you have? Oh well, I'm looking at electrical engineering. Oh, 70% guys.

There are many times that I personally had lots of bumps in my military career, that it didn't work out the way that I wanted to. So, for instance, an example is, I wanted to go to the Naval Academy when I first joined the military. They didn't accept me and I thought that was, it's the last time that I could apply. I was 22 when I joined or when I joined and tried to apply and the limit they can be is 23 and I was at that point. So, the next year I wasn't able to apply and it just, like, set me back. It felt like it really set me back. It's one of the biggest heartbreaks that I had in my life. But, you kind of, make a plan B, you look at the future, kind of, see, like, where I want to go and take that goal and you put it on your new plan B and then it should, you know, if you have the right determination and drive, then you should still get back on track somehow. So, in order to get back on track, you have to talk to your people, you have to talk to your mentors if you have any, you have to, you know, take something from yourself and say, ""You know what, even though I won't get there as fast as I was going to or as easily as I was going to, is it still a goal worth going on this new path?"" So, for me, one of the reasons that I wanted to go was, obviously to make sure that I take care of people, that I, you know, I present a good, I'm a good worker for the American people. So, I took that goal and I just did it through normal universities, I did through my nuclear technology work, I did it through research that I'm doing right now and I still think that my end goal, which is making cool products for, you know, cool computer science products and, you know, awesome new and exciting things. I'm still going to do that no matter what.

He wrote Siddhartha, which is one of my favorite books. Demian, which is another. If you've ever heard of Steppenwolf, he's the one who created that, you know, the band called Steppenwolf was named after one of his books and I've read most of his works. It taught me, well, his works taught me that, number one, there are really some bright people out there who are masters at their craft and I kind of got faith in humanity because of him. Now, I'm a STEM person and he is as humanities as you can get but despite that, I like the way that he presented what was on his mind through paper, to me. That's kind of the way that I try to make my code. I try to think, ""Well someone's going to be looking at my code later. So I have to make it very very clear. Even though it's a complex thing that I'm writing, someone has to be able to, like, look at it without me talking to them physically and understand what it is that I'm trying to, that I'm trying to present."" So, yeah it's a big jump to go from literature to computer science, you know, thinking of it the same way but he developed me mentally, based on the logic that his characters, you know, went through, like, I've had, like, difficult times in my life and I saw that his characters, even though, well this is 60-70 years ago, his characters went through some of the same things that I am going through. So, it's kind of, like, watching a really good well-written movie when I read his books. He's pretty much the only novelist that I read.

But it really opened my eyes into how computer scientists think. Halfway through the class, I realized that, you know, when I am sitting behind the computer, typing so much, which is what I thought computer science was, I thought it was like ones and zeros, bits and numbers. Most of the time, he was writing and drawing things up on the board, up on the white screen and even right now, you know, when I'm when coding, most of what I do, a lot of what I do is with sheets of paper and drawing and pictures and stuff. So, he really, like, kind of opened my eyes to what a computer scientist does. A computer scientist doesn't type code on the computer screen. That's his tool but what he does is, he thinks logically about his product and that consists of visual representations and those are things that are interesting to me and Professor Wilkinson was the first person that, kind of, showed it to me.","Tell me about a mentor that you have or had.

He went to German church and he's downstairs in the basement of this building, you know, kind of, tutoring other black kids and he was very interested and like, ""Hey, I hear the language of my family. What is this, you know, in this place?"" and he was like, ""Those two black kids over there are talking."" That really freaked him out. ""So, tell me about your story"" and we kind of told him about where we lived and about our mom and our dad and, you know, how we bounced around from place to place and spoke a little bit of German. So, he could understand that we're kind of bright. So, he said, ""Hey, you know, why don't you come over to my place?

The mechanics outside of the little station that I was at, they're on the hot deck with steam rushing by them, so it's really really sweaty and kind of greasy and they do that for six hours and they just go around walking, looking at gauges, checking oil pressure, cleaning up whenever it needs to happen and running around left and right, you know, picking up phones.

After I turned eighteen, then I split from my father and I hadn't really seen too much of my family after that. So, I had to support myself, my own finances.

So, I thought maybe economics would be, like, a job that I could, like, kind of enjoy, and you know, I like the type of math that they do and, you know, it's kind of business oriented but really, they want electronics technicians and math people and computer science people, you know, more than economics, so. The XO called me and he's like, ""Well, you know, if you would have done that, then maybe we would have considered that."" So, it feels like, ever since that day, I should, like, I wanted to go back in time and kind of change what I put on my recommendation so that I could've actually went to this really high level school and it didn't work out that way. So, instead I was a nuclear technician for eight years and I learned lots of things. I'm very happy for the job that I eventually did instead but if I had to do it again, then I guess I would have tried to make a better shot for the Naval Academy.","What are the failures for which you are the most unhappy?

I know a friend of mine who was a Chief like I am now but I was a first class when this happened. He was opening up a load breaker and, I'm sorry he was opening a circuit breaker and he was trying to check the high voltage of it and because they thought that the machine was completely powered off, they took less protection than they should have and many people were shocked when they actually put the machine in a place that it wasn't supposed to go to and he eventually wound up in the hospital, you know, burns all over his body and I was exposed to things like that all the time. In fact, as an electrician, you always are. Not all the time, not as much as some of the higher level people are. If you are kind of new, they don't expect you to work with high level equipment all the time. But if you're, you know, first class or chief or senior chief or so forth, then they expect you to, kind of, go in there and, kind of, do the test that you're supposed to. For me, personally I remember going into a breaker, that's where all of the, you know, the electricity and the current is, the high level voltage is and when I checked, it wasn't completely powered off. We didn't realize that at the time. So, if I would have touched the wrong thing at the wrong time, then it could have been an incident. However, we corrected the problem and there wasn't really any big danger to me. Things like that are bound to happen to many people because accidents happen.","What is the most dangerous thing you've ever done on the job?

This can be when you're giving some instructions and you yourself know the right thing to do. In those cases, you have to break the rules. So, this could be, an example could be, let's say you're supposed to do preventive maintenance on these three panels and because your time is, kind of, short, maybe the supervisor says, ""Only just do those two. Forget about the third one."" Or, ""You're supposed to do all three of them and you're supposed to read the notes but just do it as fast as possible"" you know, and he tells you that you're supposed to do it in a time that you can't possibly do it in. So, it's okay to break his rules in order to do the procedure correctly. You should never disregard the procedure though. If it's written down somewhere in words, don't ever break those rules. If you want to get trouble, if you want to get kicked out of the military, then be my guest, break those rules and, you know, you're going to be the first one out. But when it comes to the things that aren't black and white, when it comes to things that are, kind of, morally right or wrong, then you have to think about it yourself and think, ""Well, what was I thought, that's right?""  and so, for instance, an example would be, if you're out and you're at a bar and there's this drunk person and you're supposed to, let's say, bring him home, bring him back to the ship. But you know if you bring him back to the ship, that he's going to get in lots of trouble, maybe he will be kicked out of the military or something like that. Maybe, in that case you'll probably be wise to, for instance, not show him around the town, not show everyone that he's a drunk sailor, not bring him back to the ship so that, you know, he can be, you know, court martialed or something like that. Probably better, you know, think about it as a wise person to break the rule in that case. Find a nice hotel for him and then call your Chief as soon as possible to ask what the right thing to do is. Even though it's past your curfew time, you know, it's better to, you know, think smartly and wisely what's in the best interests of the United States military and do things that take common sense rather than, you know, this is the rule, you have to stand by.

clintanderson_A229_4_2,"Priorities, Management, Conflict","There was one time in my career as a Chief, I think it was, like, the second year that I was a Chief, as a supervisor, that my commanding officer made it clear that he wanted to keep people over the time, of the time they were supposed to be leaving, and it was four o'clock. I guess we kept people until, like, four thirty or five. I realized that people have to go and so, everyone was sent home. There was something slightly off about one of the sheets of paper that I was supposed to give him. For instance, maybe the name was supposed to written in signature but it was, like kind of, misspelled or something like that. So, something very very small and my commanding officer was really adamant about his people not leaving home so early. So, because I had let them go home early, he wanted them to come back. Now I called and I realized that the person that I let home early was an hour away. My commanding officer wanted him to come back. So, I said it's not in the best interest of that person to drive all the way back just for something small that I could correct. I could have whited it out and typed it on a typewriter and then given it back to him and that paper would have been just as good. So, even though I had a direct order from my commanding officer, ""Hey, I want you to come. Get him back into this office."" As a Chief, one of our main goals is to look out for people to, kind of, make sure that, you know, our morale is kept very high. Those are the type of people that want to work for you. Those are the type of people that say, ""You know what? Not only is he my supervisor, but he acts as a human being."" So, that's one of the times that I had to, like, stand, you know, at attention and, you know, make it clear, you know, talking to my commanding officer as a person, ""Yes, there's this rule and you have this choice but, you know what, here's another option that I'm presenting."" And even though I was yelled at, eventually that person didn't have to make the, you know, the two hour trip, just to make a small correction and the job still got done. So, things like that happen all the time as a Chief and you have to, kind of, weigh the amount of risk that you're taking with your own personal career and your own personal evaluation, compared to the kind of morale that you save by acting as a human to your sailors.","Tell me about a time when your priorities conflicted with the priorities of your management

So, in the military, there aren't, you know, at least in the United States Navy, there isn't a good gender balance, I think, from what I understand, it's maybe three girls to seven guys, maybe even less than that on an aircraft carrier. So, there can be some cat calls, there can be some kind of playful, you know, communication in the work center which, you know, should not be allowed but obviously, it does. It doesn't get too out of hand but, well, when it does, we call people out on it. Some things could be when I see some of my shipmates post pictures on their wall. So, it can come from, like, Magazine or Maxim or even Playboy in some cases and it's posted up on the wall and then after a few days, you, kind of, like, see it like, ""Hey, what's that? You know, you have to take it off."" Or, you could be out in port, let's say you're in a foreign port and you're drinking with your friends and some person comes over, it could be a guy or girl and, you know, there could be some kind of grabbing or some kind of, like, improper touching. I've seen it, very often and you have to call it for what it is and some people get kicked out of the military. I knew that there is, when I was on the reserves, I heard about this guy. He had been in for, like, twenty years or maybe longer than that and he actually grabbed a female by her rear and she called out on that and he had to quit his career and he actually had to leave without getting into retirement.

clintanderson_A231_4_2,"Background, JobSpecific","Currently, I have two different career paths that I'm going on. One is my Navy Reserve career and the other one is my computer science career. In the Navy Reserve, I'm an Electrician's Mate Chief. I've been in for 17 years, 16 going on 17 years and I became a Chief, which is pretty high level, it an E7, out of E9 total. Those are the career steps, so, E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and I am an E7. It took ten years to get there and I've been a Chief for the last six years. So, to become a Chief, it requires a lot of hard work and dedication and being an expert at your job, that's, you know, the title of what we're supposed to be. We're supposed to be able to show our junior sailors how to do things because we've done it so much ourselves. So, to get to that point, it took a lot of watch standing, it took a lot of drills, it took a lot of marching around, it took a lot of reading books, it took a lot of opening up, you know, presentations and information sheets about my job, during times that I didn't have to. I think that's the difference between a lot of Chiefs who make it and some people who don't, what you do on your free time. If you really care about your career, then, during your free time, you're not just going to watch DVDs and watch movies and play cards and just go on drums. You're actually going to spend some time trying to be advanced to the next grade, to the next promotion level. As far as my civilian career, that's me being a master's student at the University of Southern California, it took a whole lot even more, even more than the military, it took a lot more dedication, homework, assignments, test preparation. On my free time, I would spend so much time just staying up all night, just doing these homework assignments. Even after the test was over, I'd still open the book and, kind of like, get those questions that I didn't understand on the test, I would get those questions again to review, to try to understand what it is, what the class was trying to explain. So, this is math questions, science questions, even English questions. I would present an English assignment and then I get it back and, you know, ""These are all the mistakes that you made."" So, I'd open up my Central Texas College, you know, handbook and I'd say, ""Oh, there should have be a quotation there, there should have been a semicolon there"", so, even simple things like that. And all of this is in order to become an expert at whatever it is I'm learning. So, as long as you make sure that you have that final goal in mind, which is to be an expert at whatever it is that you're doing, then you'll become a high level, you'll wind up at USC at a master's course or you'll be a Chief or higher in the military.","What is your current position and how did you get there?

So, I was a noob. I was just a very new person with computer science and during the orientation, there's is this guy that's, you know, kind of, explaining what the campus is like, what life is going to be like, what you can expect from the liberal campus and I was sitting in the computer science group and to my left and right were two of my newest friends. To my left, there was a Java programmer, he'd been programming for eight years, he was an expert in this field, he'd, you know, made several programs and, like, he explained all of this to me and I'm like, ""Okay, we're going to be going to the same class, alright"" and to my right, there was somebody very very similar. He was, like, accepted to Stanford and he went to Berkeley because it's cheaper but, he had been programming since he was twelve, when he made his first computer, you know, like, blah blah blah and I was like, ""Okay, so this is the average people going to my university and we're going to be taking the, all right, I got some work for me to do."" So, that was what was on my plate when I first started going. For the military, I would say that something similar was going, I felt was going to happen. I joined the nuclear technology side of the Electrician's mate course and I had never liked engineering things at all, at all. I was the opposite. I liked driving my car but if you told me to change my oil, I would say, ""I don't think so. I'm going to take it in to Midas."" I don't like grease, I didn't like screw drivers. The biggest accomplishment I'd done, as far as, like, mechanical type things was, I had put shingles on a house and yeah, I was outside and yeah, you know, the air smelled fine but those mechanical type jobs, I just didn't feel at that time was for me. So, that's one of the reasons I actually joined the nuclear side of the Electrician's Mate. It's because, I actually wanted to challenge myself in that. I wanted to, kind of, see what that side was like, so.

clintanderson_A234_4_2,"Background, JobSpecific, Skills, Growth/Learning","When I was in college, I actually did a couple of internships and they really helped me out a lot. The very first one that I did was when I was in community college. It was right before I was accepted to my university. It was at the Naval Training Center in Orlando, Florida. So, I was in the military before so that's probably a big reason why they accepted me for this internship but we were studying something, we were doing work on something called the MSAT. It's this big huge screen that Marines, kind of, like, sit in front of, with their guns, facing the screen and they're supposed to be talking to a helicopter and the helicopter is supposed to be dropping bombs on something. So, if they didn't have this screen, they'd actually have to do it in real life. They'd actually have to be on the desert and talk to a real helicopter to tell them to drop bombs on this place and the helicopter costs money, the people in the helicopter and the pilots cost money. Being out there in the field, you know, it all costs money but if you're doing virtually, then you save so much cash. So that's one of the first things that I was doing. The internship was to look at the code and help write the script so that when the person talks to the computer, that it understands what he says. So, if he says, ""Drop an illumination bomb on set XYZ in 300 yards. Explosion."" Maybe the computer might not exactly understand what he said. Maybe the computer hears, ''Alarmination instead of illumination"" and without that word, it wouldn't do the right thing. So, my goal was to say, ""Well, hey, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination, sometimes people say illumination but no matter what they say, as long as they say il-la, then the computer should understand the rest of what he's trying to say because there's only one type of bomb."" So, that's, kind of, like, the first internship that I had. The next internship that I had was at the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies where I was a quality assurance specialist. That's where I look at a game and I make sure that it's, all of the things are supposed to be working the right way, the sound works the right way, the colors work the right way, the listening of the computer works the right way and another internship that I had, it wasn't quite an internship but it was a job, as a Residential Computing Consultant for the University of California, Berkeley where I just go around, making sure that all the students had the right operating system, could get onto the wireless network and didn't have any viruses.","What internships did you have?

When I was compared to the other people that I was working with, the other students at UC Berkeley and at USC, it seemed like they were pretty bright and I had to step up my game and to tell you the truth, even as a kid I was never really technically oriented. So, I think I had to work a little bit harder than other people to kind of get to a decent level. So, I took lots of late night study sessions, took lots of reading books, some Lynda.com courses, maybe some YouTube courses, Bucky's World, where he, kind of, explains these different programming assignments in easy to understand language rather than my professor because, like, I went to the lecturer and I didn't understand what he said so I better, like, learn on my own from this guy and then I can understand what professor said, you know, little bit better than usual.

Maybe I'll be a web designer."" And then, you start to learn about, like, the operating system and I realize, like, what scheduling is, there's lots of stuff about operating systems and I decided, ""Oh hey, let's run away from that because it's not for me."" The more things I learned about computer science, the more focused I became in what it is I wanted to do. I always knew I liked to play games and after I started learning about what designers do, I finally focused in on that aspect of computer science, which is, I'm not the best programmer, there are programmers much better than me, I'm not the best artist, obviously, you know, those people with graphic design, you know, they do their own thing but what I did like to do is, kind of, go to a whiteboard, draw things out, kind of, explain what it is I wanted other people to do and myself included sometimes too and then have that be implemented. So, the more I did that, the more I said, ""You know what? Design is probably, it's been the funnest part of my job. It's the thing that has the least debugging, which, I hate debugging."" Debugging is when you have to, like, figure out the small little tiny portion wrong with your code, you know, and it could be, like, hidden in, you know, thousands and thousands of lines of code, you know, I hate those things. So, designers, they do the funnest part of the job without all of the negative benefits of finding small areas that could take such a long time.","How have your priorities changed as your career progresses?

Of course, if there are fewer people, then that means the supply and demand thing goes like this and, you know, if there are fewer people, I'll make more money and my skill would be more desirable but that's not the way that I see it. I think that, and I've gotten flak for this before, but I say that everybody should be a programmer and my friend would say, ""How can everybody a programmer? You have to, you know, think a certain way and not everybody is, you know, mechanically, you know, programmatically and engineeringly inclined."" But I think that programming in particular, is something that not only should everybody do but it's something that everybody should learn. This is what I mean. I was looking at this five-year old and she has a tablet and with this tablet, she goes into the computer and she opens up a program, she plays whatever game she's playing and then she closes it. And to me, that is programming. You might say, ""Well, she didn't type anything."" Well, to me, she operated a computer system and it just so happens that the program that she did was very very easy, it can be done with her finger, it can be done by pressing the start menu and swiping to the left and click on this button and then she makes the thing blow up by pressing this button but this is operating, this is technically programming. It's just doing it in a very very high level abstract way. So, everybody should be able to program and everybody does. Everyone who has a smartphone is technically programming. Everybody who has a tablet is programming. Everyone who knows how to type, technically you're programming. So, I guess it depends on the degree to which you're willing to accept the definition. I think that programming should be in every job as well and to a degree it is. Most people, regardless of what job that you do, is going to be behind a computer at some point in their career. Whether you're an auto mechanic, whether you're a NASA engineer, whether you're an Electrician's Mate, you will be behind the computer doing something online and the more opportunity, the more time you spend behind that computer, the more opportunities that programming itself will help you. So, if you're an auto mechanic, yes, you can use a program that somebody created for you but if you know how to program yourself, then you can create your own program. You can customize it for whatever job you're on, even for your specific work site. So, it can only help you. So, just like I think that everybody should learn how to type and it came to be true, I think that everybody should learn how to program and hopefully it will be true one day as well.","Are too many or too few people entering this profession?

According to Moore's law, he says that we double in our computer science ability every two years and it's very very apparent in a lot of places. One place I see, which is very specific to me, is virtual reality. They said that, just a couple years ago, virtual reality will be everywhere. Facebook bought Oculus recently and it should be on everybody's head pretty soon here but it hasn't turned out to be that way but it will. I think in a couple of years, everyone will be living in a virtual reality just like everyone has a PlayStation or Xbox back home. I also see that servers, servers is not the right word, maybe database administration is going to get a really big push forward and the reason for this is because, I think everybody is going to have their own virtual avatar in one way, shape or form in the next few years. Everybody kind of does, already with Facebook, they have their own website, their own profile and in that profile, you have a big cache of pictures, you have places where they've been, you have the friend connections. All of this is, like, one little set as a person but I think that's going to be very very expanded. Not only is there just going to be your picture and your name and your pictures, but it's also going to be, maybe, some of the applications that you like to use.

This is where we're going to go. So, all of that needs to be managed and organized. So, that field is also going to explode, I think a lot. The final place, I think, is probably going to be artificial intelligence. So, we have self-driving cars, we have Tesla with its new and improve, like, hybrid cars. Maybe cars that you talk to, that you tell them where to go and then they find the most direct route to the location. You have SpaceX, where you send up rockets that require fewer and fewer people. That means that the computing needs to figure out things on its own. You have machine learning where you give the computer simple instructions and it needs to think for itself to learn, how to learn so it can, like, double or quadruple or, you know, times a hundred their original commands so that they can figure out these things on itself, by itself. So, all of  these things, artificial intelligence, machine learning, you name it, database administration, pretty much, most of computer science should, you know, take us to newer and greater heights pretty soon.","What sorts of changes are occurring in your occupation?

clintanderson_A240_4_2,"Future, Skills","For computer science, we're always changing things, all the time. So, this is the difference between the people that survived the dot crash and the people that had to go. So, an example would be, let's say Kodak, Kodak is a maker of cameras. They had the Polaroid camera. However, eventually people started using digital cameras. People started using their phones for cameras and rather than take advantage of this technology, Kodak, kind of, just sat with their usual product and as we can see, where people started to switch over their photo taking format, Kodak started to decline. Another example would be Netflix. So, I'm sorry, Netflix is an online video producer, who took over the big reign that Blockbuster used to have. Blockbuster was a big building that you go inside, you choose whichever video you wanted to, you take it up to the front, you pay your money and and you take the video for three days, then you're supposed to bring it back. If you don't bring it back, then you have to pay these fees. And Netflix kind of saw that and then they made an online video retailer store. And Blockbuster didn't follow suit with that and that's why they, kind of, like, I think, went belly-up. Maybe they're still around but they didn't get with the times. So, my point for saying this, with Kodak, with Blockbuster, you have to look a couple years in the future, maybe even longer and wherever you see technology going, that's where you have to change. Now, there's a big impetus for people to have a working product and say, ""This is our goal, this is the thing that we do."" But if you don't switch, if you don't change, then I'm sorry, technology is going to run you to the ground.","How do you proactively prepare for a decline in your field?

One that stands out, that I'm immediately thinking about is, when I went to Japan for the first time. I went to Sasebo and it's not the, you know, the most exciting thing that I've ever done but it was the first time that I was in the country that I wanted to be in, during the time that I wanted to be at for an extended amount of time. So, I was in Sasebo, which is at the very very bottom of Japan, like little city that you've probably never heard of but it's close to a couple of major cities. So, I think I went to Hiroshima which is the city that was bombed in the war, in World War 2 and that was an experience, just walking around, seeing the peace park and things like that. I went to Fukuoka, which is a really big city, similar to Tokyo, it's not as big as Tokyo but it has many of the same styles of buildings and highrises and when I was walking past one of the computers, this is what, in 2006, I noticed that it had a funny shape to it. I'm walking past and I'm like, you know, Japan is supposed to be one of the world's best electrical countries right, the ones with the highest grade electrical equipment. So, I'm walking past this computer and my eyes are kind of, like, kind of weird. It was 3D, which is kind of weird because I wasn't wearing glasses, this is just while I was walking so I looked closer and as I turned around the computer, the person was, like, looking at me and moving her face and stuff and that's the first time I had ever seen it. Even right now, this is several years later, I still haven't seen something like that. So, that's when I, kind of, realized, ""Hey, you know what? These engineers over here really know what they're doing and they're very advanced."" And, I guess another place that I went to, was Australia. So, I got to pet the kangaroos and some koalas and got to eat at the Cadbury chocolate factory. It was pretty cool. It was good times then.

Now, I have to say that they all have very similar jobs. So, you can pretty much join any of them and find something that you like. However, that's about the limit of their comparison because for instance, if you join the Navy, let's say as a cook, you could be on an aircraft carrier going around Italy and Germany and Spain. If you join the Air Force as a cook, then you might be stationed on one base, Travis Air Force Base and that's where you work, that's where you stay, you don't really get to travel so much. You won't be stationed someplace else. Now, there are army bases, military bases, navy bases, airforce bases all over the world. So, your opportunity to travel to foreign places is wide open with any service that you join. However, many of them don't have that much forward progression as far as your career. For instance, from what I hear, the Air Force doesn't really promote as well as some of the, really traveling military services like the Marines, like the Navy and in fact, many people join the Air Force and stay in the Air Force for a long time and even though that's good for the Air Force, they don't have so much retention problem, it's bad for people that want to really progress because, for instance, if you want to become, like, an E7 rate, which is a Chief in the Navy, you have to wait for someone else to either move from the military or be promoted themselves. So, for instance, with the Air Force, it might take a long time for those people to leave because, you know, the Air Force is such a great career progression whereas in the Navy, you have lots of rotation. So, your chances of being promoted are really high. For the Navy, there are many opportunities to show your desire to really take on the hard jobs. So, you could be requested to go fight overseas and if you take that job on, then they really look high on, the people that promote you really look high on those opportunities whereas for other things like the Coast Guard and the Air Force, you might not have as many opportunities. So, it really depends on what's going on in the world, where they were at war, whether you're in a job that allows you to go to harder locations to serve on submarines.

So if you don't have a degree then you can't get into their program. However, other computer science jobs that I'm considering, they don't require anything at all. So you could be walking straight out of high school and you can have that job. The only thing they require is ""Can you program this? Yes or no?"" And if you can whether you have an MIT degree or the you just have a GED from your local high school. As long as you can do the job then you can do it. So it's really important to understand the types of jobs that you want. Realize that some of them need a sheet of paper that says that you can do the job, and some of them just are mostly based on experience in your own life. For me, I joined the Navy, I got this certificate from the military, which isn't a college class and then after I got out, then I could have this really high paying job without going to college myself. There are many people who say college isn't that important.

But whatever your level is, maybe you're not calculus ready yet, just take your bottom math and even though you weren't good at it before you know, it's kind of important. So bust out your high school skills, bust out your homework doing skills, and try to take on a mathematical class. Even if you have to repeat one, even though you did it in high school, try to do it over again if that's not your strong suit. Any science class could or could not, so you might not be using chemistry so much, so you can probably skip that unless you have some kind of chemical intensive job, but physics is a good one. I've seen many physics concepts in all of my engineering jobs that's computer science that's nuclear technology. Math, all the math that you can, as high as you can, up to differential equations.

You kind of know like where the calculus is in that, but I I never use it I just know it's there and all that effort just to understand why a gauge like moves up and down like acceleration and stuff like it's, yeah there are other things I could have learned to help me you know.

So I went to three different colleges. I went to Pasadena City College, that's in the Los Angeles area. I went to University of California, Berkeley it's up near San Francisco, and I went to USC, that's also near the Los Angeles area. One big thing was the landscape. All three of those places were absolutely beautiful, Berkeley is kind of up on a hill, USC has beautiful pristine buildings, and my community college, it looked like a university. It was right beside Caltech, California Institute of Technology and you can tell that they're right beside each other because I couldn't tell the difference that it was a community college so. The people around is another big thing that's very important. So I like diversity. All three of my universities you walk around and you know all different shapes, sizes, and colors. Right now where I'm at in Japan it's not so much. So you can kind of really tell the difference and for me I just like seeing people similar to me, and different than me, and smarter than me, and people that I could trash in math you know. So I like that whole entire spectrum of people. Also I think the biggest thing for me when I decided my university was the reputation. So I tried to go to the best that I could. In fact I wasn't accepted to Berkeley the first time that I applied, and I said you know what I came from Washington all the way back to California my hometown specifically to go to this university, so once I was rejected, I went back to my university, I studied even harder, I got a 4.0 that semester, I took on another job, I did research, I did all the things, I took extra classes, I did all of the things to make me a really more mature, more intelligent person to finally get into that university, because I realize that worldwide, wherever I mentioned that university people would automatically know the process that I had to go through the schooling that I got, and it would give me you know the jobs that I needed, and maybe the math and the science and engineering and the programming that I required to do my future things. So reputation was probably the biggest thing for me when I chose the college that I did.","What influenced you the most in your college decision?

At my undergrad UC Berkeley I was a resident computing consultant which is kind of a job to help students get their wifi and their computer set up. When I was in Japan I was part of that aikido club which meant that, it's kind of like martial arts where you people attack you and you put them on the ground a certain way.

The more you put at school, the less you can do outside of school obviously. So if you don't have that much time, then paying for school is very very difficult. When I graduated from high school and I tried to do college at the same time I was working, it was very very difficult so one of them had to give and unfortunately I couldn't stay in school that whole entire time. After that then I joined the military, I did my eight years, and then I had a good scholarship to help me pay for the rest of my education. I still had to work a little bit, but that was more for my own personal benefit, I didn't need the money, but when I needed the money and I had to work that was really difficult.","What was the most difficult part of your education?

They also look at your intelligence, how well you know it, if you're an expert or not. So I did waste a lot of time, I did play lots of video games, I did watch lots of Netflix, and maybe college isn't the right place to do that. You have the whole rest of your life to really enjoy things to the maximum, but college is the place to study, so of course I should relax a little bit, but I wish I would have really studied a little bit harder.

I've been to a public university, private university, community college, and I think that the best education that I've ever received was from the military, and there's a reason for this. They want to make sure that the people that go through their educational system, whether it's for two weeks, whether it's for two years, you need to know your stuff very well. People's lives are gonna be at risk and you have to be able to handle multimillion dollar equipment without breaking it. After that, after your military career if you choose to do something else, people know this. So that's why sixty percent of the nuclear technologists outside are ex-Navy because they know that the Navy people know their jobs well. Regardless of what your job is, whether it's being a spy as a crytotechnologist, whether it's being the nuclear Navy, whether it's being the cook.

One is the military, and I'm still in the military because I'm in the reserves, and one is computer science. With the military, they provide so much training for you. In fact, even though some of the us are pushing it away, they provide you with training here and there, it's really required if you want to progress in your career. So they give you books that you can read, we have online video tutorials all the time. When you're at work people come up to you and they provide you training over and over and over. So it's pretty much handed to you on a plate. That's in contrast with my computer science career, where I don't have a main supervisor. And if I do have a main supervisor, he's not providing me with required material to learn. So basically it's hands on learning, it's manual learning, it's learning on your own at your own free pace. So both of those ways I found are really comfortable. I like the online video tutorials and the instant training that I get from the military because it's so easy and it's very very clear what I am supposed to learn. With computer science I have a wide range of things that I can learn, and it basically is going to dictate what I can do for my future careers. So if I wanna learn python, then while I'm whittling down that path then I can become a Google web developer because they use python a lot. However if I say well python is too easy I wanna learn something a little bit more complex and I learn Perl. Well not many people use, many people use Perl but it's a different style of programming and those jobs can hire me, so I can learn at my own pace.

I think that's pretty standard for all military services. However, they don't all provide you with the same amount of time to do it. For instance, in the Navy, they don't give me any time to exercise, you always have to do that outside of your working hours. I think for the marines they probably do, it's probably inherent in you know waking up in the morning and you all PT together. Probably the army is similar that way too, depending on what type of job you have.

When we're working and we can get greasy in lower parts of the ships, we also have these things called coveralls, which are all blue, it's one size and you just put your legs in and you put the tops and you zip up and it looks like an oil changer for a car. It's the same type of uniform and you can wear these belts that allow you to put in you know wrenches and tools and fuse pullers and things like that, so it's very, it's work related.

There are many jobs out there that can be transferable, anything that's engineering related is highly transferable. Even though you're on a ship or on a submarine or with military equipment. The concepts the chemistry, the math and science, they're all transferable. Other jobs aren't quite as transferable.

So for instance when I got to my first aircraft carrier I did something that most people don't do, I actually flew in because they were fighting the Iraq war. I actually flew in on a huge jet to land on the aircraft carrier. Mostly only the officers do that, they're the ones who take off in the jets on the aircraft carrier. Also if you're on leave, you can actually take off in a jet to go to different places in America and across the world as long as you're on leave and you have the right permission to. So you can go from a military base, we call Space-A flights, and it's either cheap or very very free. But otherwise you don't really get to do it so much.

You have to have a bachelor's of science something that's accredited by an institution to even be considered for the job at all. So in that case, your training is definitely required. Not only do you need a degree that says that you can do the job, but you're gonna be tested and grilled during the interview process where they're going to see if you learned the thing that your degree says that you do know. So in those cases it's very hard to have that degree. Middle jobs in between, it varies. They're gonna really grill you pretty hard during the interview process with questions that you don't really know about. Simple questions and hard questions. The simple questions of course they're going to want you to know, the harder questions what they're looking for is the way that you're trying to solve the problem. They're not going to expect you to know, maybe you'd have to be seasoned to know it, and they want to see the way that the question stews in your mind. They want to see if you know how to attack the problem, and if you know to ask them the right questions, to ask your teammates the right questions, so that they can provide you with the answers so you can finally come up with a solution. If you can't, you don't have a structure in your mind, then you probably won't get the job. So for those types of jobs, you just have to have a basic introduction and you learn the rest on the job during your work experience there.","How important is it to have the right training, degree or experience?

What I would suggest is you should first figure out what type of job you want to do, and then try to combine the classes that you're taking and the job that you have into both of them. As an example, I wanted to do computer science education. Therefore in my classes, I took computer science as a major and education as a minor. I'm really glad I got to see both of those parts of my undergraduate university. When I'm doing computer science, it's very math oriented, science oriented, lots of homework every night. The education part was very writing intensive, talking and debating, and I like both of them. The reason I chose those majors is because I knew what my future job was going to be. So if your job is very technically oriented, then I suggest that you stick with an engineering major and really focus hard at that. But if that's not your cup of tea, kind of like me, then that's when should try to focus, that's when you have the opportunity to do both of them.","How can I study STEM and another area?

Starting with the officers because they're easy, in order to be an officer you automatically have to have a degree. There are some officers who don't, but ninety-nine percent of them, they start off with a degree. You can become a lieutenant and even higher, there are many captains who don't have advanced degrees. However, to get very high, you are generally expected to get a master's at least. That's around the O5/O6-ish level because they like to see education. Going to enlisted people, you don't need any degree for the whole entire time that you're in. However, education is looked upon highly and if you do have a degree your chances for promotion to be honest, are a lot higher. Up to my rate, E7, it's really not looked on as being a requirement. However, from my rate and above, that's E7 and above, so that's E7, E8, and E9, they really spur on the education. So education in any way, if you've taken vocational classes, that's a check mark. If you have your degree while you're in the military, that's another big check mark too. So any education at all, whether it's from a traditional college, whether it's your own personal learning and you took CLEP (College Level Examination Program) classes or online classes, anything will set you apart from the others.","What is the typical education level at each stage of a career in the military?

I could have opened up my computer and took online classes, and I did do that, but there really is a different style of learning that you go through when you're listening from a lecture and then you have other teammates, other peers that you're working on to solve a big group project. So for instance, I'm taking game development at the University of Southern California and we made our own game. Now it would have been very very difficult for me to do that all on my own. The artwork that's involved, the production that's involved, the design that's involved, the programming. Just by myself, I think it would have been, for the game that I created, it's a really big one, it would be too much for me to do by myself. What I needed was a group of ten other people, or twenty other people, sometimes even thirty other people, to all come together to create this one lasting project that I can call my own that was in a safe environment like a community college class.

It's going to show up. Even though they know that they're not supposed to. You can see it in the bars that we go to, they kind of forget that they're still in the military. So outside of working hours you can see them kind of drinking and kinda you know hugging each other, like touching each other inappropriately, that happens a lot.

So, if you're good at puzzles, if you get some kind of question that you don't know the answer to but you're willing to, kind of, research that until you find the solution, then STEM is a good career for you. This is what I mean. For me, as an electrician, there isn't that much math that I did and there's not that much science that I did. However, when I'm looking at a circuit and I see that one part is open and I'm familiar with most of the things on the circuit. Well, this is a short, this is a motor, this is a generator, this is a capacitor but there are some things on there that I don't know. If I put down the circuit and say, ""Well, I guess that's it."" Then, maybe STEM isn't good enough for me, well, maybe I'm not good enough for STEM. However if I can look at it and I realize that I don't know the situation and I can turn around to other people or I can look in the book myself and figure out, ""Okay, well, so that's what this thing does. Well, let's look at the power. I don't understand the way that this math works."" So, let me again look to see, like, ""Okay, well this goes up, this goes down, this is the function for this"" and then look at another book, it's like,""Oh, okay"" and then I can backtrack all the way to that component to kind of figure out what it does at the end. If I'm willing to do that process, then STEM is for me. It's kind of like a goose chase. If you like goose chases and the goose chase that you're doing is math and science oriented and that's fun for you, that sounds like something that's fun, then STEM is for you. If you just look at a problem and you get really frustrated and you want to throw the book out the window, if you found yourself doing that a lot, then there are other jobs that you might find more interesting and more fun, more satisfying than STEM.","What kinds of people succeed in STEM fields?

But it is an option, especially if you have, like, a STEM related career where you know you're going to make that money back in a fast way.

There are other companies where you have your own cubicle and if you don't want to talk to anyone the whole entire day, eat lunch by yourself, then you're more than welcome to do that.

So I took one class each semester for over two breaks in the summer, and they were really good, they were really fun, and I got A's in both classes.

So they, if you're a good sailor, if you have a good evaluation and they think that you're tip-top, then they will suggest you to go to the officer route. In that case you go to a one of the schools that they select. There are several other ways as well, there's officer candidate school and there's direct commissioned officer.

So for instance, if I'm computer science, then they're going to give me a broad general spectrum of what computer science is. Your graduate school, it depends on whether you go to masters or PhD.  Masters' courses, they vary. I'm in a masters course that has only classes and it doesn't have any research oriented work. However, most masters students are, they have some kind of strong research element, component to them, that's as opposed to undergraduate school. PhD is strictly and specifically for doing research.  So, at the bottom you have, not bottom, but at the lower end of the spectrum, you have undergraduate where you get your basic theory, you have your master's which can be on the path to a PhD or it can be vocational, and you have your PhD which is very academic and strictly for research.","What's the difference between undergraduate and graduate school or education?

I really wanted to focus on my school, focus on my work. However when I looked at what was available I kind of saw that the jobs that you have in college are really really important for your success, for understanding what it is you're doing. When I was an undergrad I became a residential computing consultant which is someone that goes to the dormitories, looks at people's computers fixes their wifi. That experience was so great. It's one of the crowning glories of my Berkeley experience because I remember those things. I remember the people. I remember the coworkers that I had, and the parties that I went to, it was very, very good. Not only that, it paid a decent amount of salary that helped me get through my college years. When I became a graduate school, I also had the impression like no I'm gonna go to school, I'm going to focus on my classes and not worry about jobs. I had enough money to support myself. However a job showed up, the job that you're seeing right now that I'm doing, that really fit in to my major specifically. I study game development and a job came along that said well if you've been in the military, and if you are studing game development, and if you know computer science and if you're interested in game design, then we have a job for you. So that was, it was awe-inspiring that a job like that existed for me, and again in my graduate school that's one, it's one of the main things that I remember from my education. So having a job can be an integral part of your college experience if you choose the right one.","Did you work while in college?

So I was going to Berkeley and it's known for being really really educationally intensive, right, and I didn't really see that so much in my computer science classes and even my language classes, there's just lots of work and you're expected to do, you know like, be up until midnight. But this course, this discourse analysis, it really showed me-it was taught by a really smart professor, and she, she really knew what she was talking about. We studied things like Martin Luther King speeches or the way that a politician twists words to make it seem like he's answering the question but he really answers something different, and these are things that even as a smart person, you know, growing up I listened to and I just accepted, but I never really thought about as succinctly as she taught me how to.

But for ninety five percent of the places if you're one of the top students in your class then you can go to the local state school and you can be just fine. That said if you wanted, if your heart is set on going to a very prestigious school, then yes grades matter and yes SAT scores matter, but I think the thing that pushes everybody over the top is what you do outside, what you do outside of those walls that define your high school.

So it's really helping you along the way and you know trying to learn about what jobs there are talking to military members .

That's what I always compared it to, normal nine to five job, you wake up nine o'clock to do the same thing, it's lots of work, there's lots of repetition, sometimes for my jobs until five o'clock and you go home pretty tired. College on the other hand, it's, number one it's very sporadic. On Mondays I have one class in the morning. On Tuesdays I have a class in the morning and then a night class in the evening. On Wednesdays I have three classes in a row but they're only one hour long and they're just all over the place and that's the first thing, that the schedule is different. The second thing is that each of those classes you know for a fact is going to be different. They're not gonna teach the same thing that they taught three weeks ago and then two weeks ago and then this week. You know you're on a different chapter, gonna be learning different things. If you're in chemistry you're gonna be working with different beakers. If you're in a robotics class you're gonna be working with robots this weekend and then the legs next week. Every single week is very, very different. The third thing is that it's challenging. So, in my nine to five jobs I'm either flipping burgers or I'm selling popcorn. Even with the harder jobs, you can be in a situation that it's very, very similar week to week, and because it's so similar, it's not very challenging. But with college, depending on how good you want to do, and of course I say if you wanna go to college you wanna ramp up your difficulty as much as possible, then you're gonna be challenged all the time. You're gonna have projects that you are gonna be working on overnight-you don't have that in a normal nine to five job. You're gonna be coming in on the weekends voluntarily-you don't have that with a normal nine to five job. You're gonna be working with different people and not knowing the answer and asking around and opening up books. You're actually gonna be going to the library for a purpose, not just to read Greek mythology. You don't have that in a nine to five job.

I went to Japan when I was in undergrad, and I went to Japan again when I was a gradute student. I also went to Mexico when I was in community college, and those three moments stick out like sore thumbs when I think about my college careers. That being said, so Mexico helped me because it was on my way to being a transfer student. But did going to Japan help me with my Berkeley career? Well, when I went there none of the classes counted towards completion of my degree, so people would say, well no, what a waste of time right? But number one the classes that I took were computer science based. Well one was science and technology in Japan and the other was a C++ class and coding concepts and you know none of those had anything to do with like making me closer to graduation, but they improve myself as a person. But more than that, college is not just about getting that degree and the fastest way there, it's about developing yourself as a person, and even if I went to Japan just to study flowers and do bonsai cutting, I'm pretty sure that that situation would make me a better person later on down the route. You might remember Steve Jobs, he was the CEO of Apple, and he said that taking caligraphy classes helped him so much later on in his future career as a computer science businessman.

Right, they don't really focus so much on engineering as a cultural experience. They say it's really difficult and it's pretty much for the the top twenty or ten percent of the students. You have to be smart to do it. That's not so much the case let's say in Japan and China where all students are expected to have a very very thorough understanding of mathematics and science. Even to get into college you should be, you should have pretty high SAT scores, or their version of the SAT, so you consider that to even go to a good college. Not only that it's taught from when they're really young to really older that just you know fill in your weak points, whereas in America they say well if you're not good at it well there are other things to do why don't you try music right.

So for instance, when I was young I really wanted to be a linguist. I wanted to know five different languages by the time I was twenty five. I wanted to speak fluently and travel in my jet around the world and I don't think engineers really do that so much, so when I joined the military to become a nuclear technologist, I realized that I wasn't doing something that I was passionate for, I was doing something that was challenging instead and that still worked out, I still enjoyed it. I still enjoyed doing the Navy for that, but I had to kind of change my mind set for that. After I got out of the military, then I had this eight years of being a nuclear technologist I could become like Homer Simpson, make lots of money and I had so much experience that I could have a high paying job, a high position job out in the real world. However after studying what computer science is and finding my passion in that, I kind of gave up that nuclear technology course and I studied engineering and computer science which is kind of like starting from fresh. So the two choices that I made, number one from humanities to engineering over to nuclear technology and then after that from nuclear technology to computer science those are really distinct choices and it is what it is I'm happy with my decisions.","What do you give up to study STEM?

You get your housing paid for, and you get to wear a cool uniform, but otherwise it's very very similar to college.

I remember I was really really into that game I was practicing day and night, I'd barely eat, you know eating pizza while programming. I was you know taking a break with my girlfriend watching a Netflix movie and then go back to that programming. You know staying up till midnight you know she gets up in the in the middle of the night like ""Hey, are you still programming?"" It's like yep, you know still going all the way up until the morning, really being challenged.

Not everybody can do that so chances are you can wind up in a job that you're very interested in, even though it's not your passion. Maybe your passion is just your hobby. So the job that you have number one you want it to pay the right salary.

However, I think that there are many places that you can learn computer science from or ways that you can learn computer science that are gonna be very difficult, and it doesn't need to be. One of the reasons that I'm learning education is to make those things easy. You open up a math book and chances are that that math book has been taught by, has been written by one of the leading mathematicians. You know he's one of the top of his field that's why he has the authority to write this book. However, not all the best mathematicians make the best teachers, and I think specifically for engineering and for STEM, you need the best teachers, the best, the ones who know how to relay the information the best, not just the best in the field. You can be a so-so mathematician, but as long as you can help somebody who doesn't know about it to know it is well as you, then those are the people that should be teaching and right now that's just not the case.","What don't you like about STEM/CS?

We go on these things called deployments where you're on a boat like a destroyer or an aircraft carrier. You go into the middle of the ocean and then those things provide support to the combatants. My aircraft carrier supported aircraft that go and drop bombs and you know shoot things. So my role was to support them. Those days were really long, really intensive sometimes. You can wake up at 6 AM, and then you might not have an opportunity to go to sleep until night the next day, and there are many days like that. There are days that you would be really tired, but you have to fight through it, you have to fight through the sleep, you have to drink lots of coffee, you have to really be very mature so that you don't make mistakes on the job that can endanger somebody. So after going through all of those those deployments, you know six months, seven month, eight month long deployments, I come away with a couple of things. Number one, respect for those people that do that. I think even though right now maybe I might not go on another deployment, but I really respect the veterans who have served, and even the combatants. Number two, I know that for myself, I can almost be faced with anything and be able to take it head on. I don't think that I'll be in another situation that is that intensive in my life. There can be situations like that, but I don't think I'll ever sweat as much, I don't think I'll ever be as sleepy as much, I don't think I'll ever be trained as much as I was during those times.

So, for instance, when I was in the military, we would have to explain how the propulsion system works to people who had no idea about it, who were cooks, or journalists or media representatives. So they would come, have no idea about engineering, have no idea about what steam, is what electricity is, how it works. And by the end of that, my little tour, they had to kinda understand it, they had to have a board they'd run, they'd have to kinda explain what I told them. And for the most part everyone told me, you know what, I understand it now. Everyone said, wow, you know like, that's so interesting, have few questions, but I think that I got it.  No one came away confused. I think that's one of my strengths. When I try to teach kids English, English I know really well, so I can explain like, simple concepts very very good.

I remember being in my Japanese class and having all these conjee homework assignments and you know opening your book and reading and practicing and there was a time that I kinda just wanted to relax and enjoy my summer and I didn't practice and because I didn't practice during that intensive time with people who really wanted to see me succeed, who had all the tools, who had all the the toys and the stickers and everything that's helped me succeed, worksheets, and I just didn't do that and now I'm suffering for it. Now I can't communicate with the people around me. Another one is programming, there are so many opportunities to go talk to really smart people at Berkeley, who had the time and the knowledge and the care and the money to sit down and really give me that tutoring one on one session, but I didn't go to those things and now I'm suffering for it.

It's an aircraft carrier, so unless you're doing really really fast movements when there are lots of waves, it really actually feels like you're in a building, most of the time. But I have been on a submarine, and those things are really small, smaller in comparison, and they go down and up and I think there's a big case of seasickness on those, on those places. Also, on the smaller ships, there's a lot of up and down movement, and I've seen a couple of people mention that, you know that they were feeling queasy. I've never seen anyone do the hurling thing.","Does it get claustrophobic and sea sick on the ship?

clintanderson_A369_7_2,"JobSpecific, Military","When you are in the military, they kind of expect to get the biggest burden from you when you first join. Because you, you come in as a fresh civilian who's been on you know, on land the whole time so when you first get there, you're expected generally to go on a ship for your first command. You do that for about four years and that should be the end of most people's, of many people's careers. So then they go off and become civilians again. So they just do one sea tour. However if you're going to stay in longer, at that time, then they want to give you a break from so much sea time. Sea time can be difficult. So then they probably send you to shore command for two or three years. After that, then you have this cycle. About three or four years on sea duty, two or three years shore, three or four years sea, two or three shore. And then you're probably going to finally end up with four more years or three more years of sea duty and then that's your twenty years. If you stay in longer, then they'll probably shorten your sea command a bit, because you're a little bit older, you're a little bit wiser and sea is for, sea is for those young, those young bucks.","How long are you on the ship for?

I never miss my family, the family that I did have, because I was too independent. However, I did find myself, being in the middle of the ocean, after two or three months, just wanting to come home and experience day to day things. Daily life. I wanted to watch movies, I wanted to drive my car around. I wanted to go to the mall and meet girls and experience life. The life of a young twenty year old. And when you're out to sea, you really don't have those opportunities. So that's my version of being homesick. Just wanting things that you probably think are very normal. Those things are like gold to me when you are out on deployment.","Did you miss home while in the Navy and how did you handle it?

And I think for the most part people, people stay with the people who were with them in A school, the initial school that you go to. For the most part, for the first four years. His name was Will. We both did electrical engineering together for A school. We split up, but when I went to my first shift, an aircraft. It was in San Diego. He had the opportunity to tell the navy that, and they can kind of hook up people who were in the same school together, so that happened. So we spent our first aircraft carrier as well. And based on that, you know we lived together, and he eventually got married and we're still friends to this day.","Who was your best friend in the Navy?

It's a reserve status.That means that if there's a war, you're one of the first people that they would call, rather than civilians to go fight the war. And the reason that they do that is because they know that you've been trained. The two days per month, two weeks per year, during that time they train you so that you know your job very well. If you're an electrician, like I was, then they're going to teach you how to operate in a military structure when you're back home. Or when they send you to different places during those two weeks per year, so for instance, I go to New Hampshire from my home in California. So when you go over there, then they actually put you on a ship. And then you're actually doing real, active duty physical work.  So you get trained both places. Back home, I learn what a chief does and how he interacts with people. And when I go on my two week annual training, then I actually learn what an electrician does. So when a war happens, then I'm one of the first people that they call. We get paid the exact amount for the time that we're in. In fact, they pay us a little bit more, because they realize that they're taking us from our normal civilian job.

However, I have witnessed, well not witnessed, I have known of people who have gotten seriously injured. So for instance, someone that I spent a couple years with on my first aircraft carrier, that person became a chief, and he went to the next ship and unfortunately he was in a very large circuit breaker accident. All the navy heard about it, and it especially affected his last ship. We all knew him. That's just one example. Every now and then you hear about people falling down stairs or you know running down and like hitting their head on one of the thin windows, the thin sills of the doors.

On my contract before I joined, they said well if you're a nuclear technician then you get automatic advancement to E3. So during boot camp I was actually, I had three stripes on my shirt. However, I was getting paid as the lowest class. You don't actually get to have that salary until you finish your boot camp and you go on to your first A school. In boot camp it really doesn't mean too much whether you have one stripe or two stripes or three stripes. It's just kinda like there for maybe for self motivation but as soon as you get to your A school, you don't have any responsibiltiies. You're not in charge of anybody.

clintanderson_A376_7_2,"Culture, Colleagues, Lifestyle, Military,Navy","Once you join the military you're going to really find that your service is broken up into two chunks. It's when you're back at home and when you're out on deployment. When you're back at home,then you're going to find that your job is basically 9 to 5. You're going to wake up just like everybody else in the world, do your job, have lunch, and then go home at 5 o'clock and then you're just free to do whatever you want. So the way you normally meet people, meeting them at the malls, at the library, at clubs, at bars. Those are the same ways that you're gonna find. When you're on deployment however, things are a lot different. When you're just on that boat, it feels very claustrophobic sometimes. Especially, at least for me, I realized that most of the people that I was around are many guys. I think the ratio is like seventy percent male to 30 percent on the aircraft carrier. So you're going to be in a space, you're talking to them all at the same time, all the same people. However on those deployments, you do get to have port calls, which means that you go into another country like Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, or Thailand and for four days or five days then that's your day to roam free. Most of the time, you get liberty. That means that you get to have those days off. During that time, your chance to meet people are increased substantially. So for instance, when I was in Australia, they knew that we were coming in. They knew that the Navy was going to be there. So many people would come in from other places just to spend time in those hotels and experience our lives and our culture. When you go to a bar, people know that you're in the military, because you look different. You have a clean shaven face and maybe there aren't that many black people there or there aren't that many Hispanics there. So you stand out. Then they're going to want to come up to you. That's something that doesn't happen in the United States. No one, you know--people don't just show up and buy you a beer. So it can be easier at times when you have those moments of freedom, when you're on deployment. When you're back home, it's the same as anything else.","How do you meet people in the Navy?

But if you're just butting heads, you kinda keep your mouth shut. You just sit there, you stay off in your own world. It's better to, especially when you're around expensive equipment, to not be so talkative and perform your work rather than getting in an argument and then having to be on the watch with this person for the next five years (who you're arguing with) you don't want that to happen.

If you find yourself poor or you don't really know what you're going to be doing, then the military is a great option. If you're poor then they're going to give you a salary that takes care of you from day one. You're never going to have to worry about housing. If you're financially responsible from that point on, you'll have a steady income. You'll have a place over your head. You'll know what job you're going to have the next year. You don't have to worry about being fired. If you weren't a good student in school, of course there's a limit that you have to be smart enough to join. You have to be able to pass the tests that it takes to get there. However, if college isn't in your future, and if you don't want to do a job that you feel is very very below your level, then the military can be a great option, because they have so many different jobs available to you that you don't need a college degree for. If you're interested in writing, if you're interested in playing music, or even being an engineer, many of those jobs require some kind of advanced degree or some kind of specialized training. But the military, as long as you can pass the test and that's an option available to you, then you can take it. So people that don't know what they want to do, people that need some kind of financial security, people that even want to go to college, the military has great opportunities for you to further your education. Be it by getting your degree, by getting advanced certificates, by just having the vocational experience. For instance, if you want to join a job later on, you say, well I used to fix aircraft for the military. You don't even need a degree for that, they can say that experience is good enough to join this job.

I'm learning some skills that you know I wouldn't have learned otherwise just by tutoring, just by talking one-on-one back in the States. Number two, I'm experiencing the food and the culture and the life and the language of Japan, and I needed that because, I guess, going to school all the time, studying computer science, you kinda get drained. So this is kinda like my break to experience someting new, something worldwide and Japan is really great for that. Number three, the payment here is pretty, pretty decent. It's not, you know, outstanding but as a student, you know, year after year after year USC is pretty expensive, so I actually came here and I've been saving up a little bit of money. It's going to help me, so I don't have to worry about that so much when I go back. Number four, I'm here because I really wanted to focus on, you know, give a lot more effort to my startup.
